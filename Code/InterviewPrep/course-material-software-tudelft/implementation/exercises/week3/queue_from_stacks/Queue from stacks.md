In this exercise you have to implement the class `Queue`, which is a `Queue` based on `Stack`s.

The `__init__` function is already given and you should not modify it. You cannot use other data structures or more than 2 `Stacks`s.

Implement the remaining functions. Comments above the functions describe their wanted behaviour.

An implementation for the `Stack` class is given in the library code.
