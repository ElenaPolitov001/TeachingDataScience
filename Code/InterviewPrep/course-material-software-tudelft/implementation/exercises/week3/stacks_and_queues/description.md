You love listening to music just as much as everyone else, but with platforms like Spotify and Youtube you find it
difficult to enjoy your ADS (Algorithmic Daily Songs) playlist as there are way too many advertisements interrupting your songs.
Since you have been following an algorithmic course for 3 weeks now, you feel confident in your programming skills
and decide to implement your own music app. In order for your app to function correctly you need a playlist which you 
can listen to, skip songs and go back once you've realized you have skipped your favourite song. For this purpose we have
provided you the structure of your playlist class and all you have to do is implement the required methods so you can enjoy
your playlist without interruptions. <br>
An **_important_** note is that you are not allowed to use any additional data structures
different from the ones we give you in the visible library.

    <summary>Hint: What data structure to use?</summary>
     In order to keep track of the current song you are playing and the list of songs you are yet to play and the ones you
     have already played you need an appropriate datastructures in which you will store the songs. To give you a 
     headstart we have provided you with a library consisting of an implementation of a Stack and SpecialQueue. It's your task to 
     figure out how you can make use of them.

     As you can see we give you a rather small playlist and test only that you actually play a song. If you want to test 
     your code we encourage you to write more test yourself so you make sure your favourite playlist works just fine
     with your application. In the spectests we will test your app against our all time favourite songs so make sure
     all the functionalities work correctly in order for us to enjoy our music.
