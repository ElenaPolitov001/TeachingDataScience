In this exercise you have to implement bubble sort on a linked list. The function `sort` will take as input a `SLL`, singly linked list, and sorts this list in ascending order using the values stored in the nodes.

The implementation for the singly linked list can be found in the library. 

**IMPORTANT:** You are not allowed to use any data structures other than the linked list we provide.
