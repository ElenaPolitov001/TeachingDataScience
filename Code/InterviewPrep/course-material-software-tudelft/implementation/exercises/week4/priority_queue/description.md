After taking his long deserved holiday in the summer, your favourite teacher has just returned back to work, to find 
the huge pile of tasks he has to finish before the quarter starts. He has to prepare his slides for the lectures, 
develop the assignments for the lab and come up with tough but fair exam questions. Each of the tasks has a certain 
duration and Stefan has a given number of computers that he can finish the tasks on. Therefore he asks for your help. 
He gives you the list of tasks he has to do in that order and the number of computers he can use and you should let him know how much time
it will take him to finish everything, given that tasks done on different computers can run in parallel. To help you with your 
job we give you the implementation of the `Task` and `PriorityQueue` class, which you should use. Your solution has to be as
efficient as possible as Stefan has no time to spare.
