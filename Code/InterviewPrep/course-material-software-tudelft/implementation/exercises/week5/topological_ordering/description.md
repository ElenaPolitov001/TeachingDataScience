In this exercise you have to implement the function `topological_ordering`, this function takes as input a graph and returns a topological ordering of the graph as a list.

The input for the tests will always be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). You do not need to consider the cases, where the graph might contain cycles.

In the library you will be able to find an implementation for the graph, note that this is a directed graph.
