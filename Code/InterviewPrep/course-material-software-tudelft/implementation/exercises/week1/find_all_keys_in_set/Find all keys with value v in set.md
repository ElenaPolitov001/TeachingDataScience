In this exercise you have to implement the `find_keys` function. 

The function takes as input two things, a number (`num`) and a dictionary (`my_dict`), where the dictionary maps a string (key) to a set of integers (value). Given this input the function will return a set with all the keys for which `num` is in its set.

For example given the following dictionary, `{"x": {1, 2, 3}, "y": {2, 4}, "h": {4, 5}}`, if we look for the number `4`, the expected output would be a set with the keys `"y"` and `"h"`.
