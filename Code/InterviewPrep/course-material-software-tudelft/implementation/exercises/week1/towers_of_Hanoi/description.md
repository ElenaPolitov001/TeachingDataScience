In this assignment you have the task to solve the famous "Towers of Hanoi" problem. The legend tells the following:

_"In an ancient Hindu temple at the center of the world the priests were given a stack of 64 golden disks of decreasing size. 
The disks were stacked on one of three pegs. The priests were asked to move the tower of disks from the starting peg 
to another. It was said that when they completed their task, the temple would crumble to dust and the world would come to an end."_ Text by [Derek Liu](http://www2.mtsd.k12.wi.us/homestead/users/ordinans/Tower%20of%20Hanoi.html).

While completing this ancient problem you have only 2 rules to watch out for:

- Due to their enormous weight, you can move only one disk at a time.
- To make sure the smaller disks are not crushed by the larger ones, you may never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

You are asked to implement your solution in the `hanoi` method provided, without using any additional data structures.

**IMPORTANT:** In an exam environment your code will be checked manually to make sure you have not cheated the spec
tests and your grade will be overwritten to 1 if you have deviated from the rules.
