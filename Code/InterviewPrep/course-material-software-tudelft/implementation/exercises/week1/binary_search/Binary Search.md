In this assignment, you will implement the binary search algorithm.

You have to find the element `item` in the sorted list `items_list`.

The algorithm should run in \\(\mathcal O(\log n)\\) time.

Note that both a recursive and an iterative implementation (i.e. with a loop) are possible. The recursive implementation has been discussed during the lecture.
