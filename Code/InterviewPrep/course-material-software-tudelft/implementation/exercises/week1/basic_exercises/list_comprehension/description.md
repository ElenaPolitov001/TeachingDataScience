In this assignment you are presented a couple of basic python exercises you have to implement. Make sure to read the 
comments before each function to understand what it's supposed to do and if there are any further requirements.

    <summary>Hint: write tests</summary>
    We have provided you 2 visible tests for the functions we give you. It's highly recomended you explore those first and try to write 
    similar tests for your own functions as well. In Python a `test` is not much different from a normal `function`, in which you assert 
    the condition you want to test on the `self` instance. You can do this by calling `self.assert...()` with the correct type of assertion and
    the outcome you want to compare followed by the expected outcome inside the parentheses.
