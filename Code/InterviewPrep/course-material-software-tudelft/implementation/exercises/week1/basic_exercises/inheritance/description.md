In this assignment you should make use of inheritance in python. In the visible `library` you can find the basic
 implementation of the `Polygon` class. Your task is to extend that to the class `Triangle` and create a method
 called `find_area` taking `self` as an input and calculating the area of the triangle for which it is called, rounded to 1 decimal point.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your method is called `find_area` otherwise the spec-tests will fail.
