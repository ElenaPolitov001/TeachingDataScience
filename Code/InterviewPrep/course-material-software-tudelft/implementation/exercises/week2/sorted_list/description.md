Meet Ray. He is an old-fashioned guy and unlike most of us at TU Delft, he does not like credit cards and prefers to carry
cash in his wallet. Apart from that he is a really organized person, which means that all his notes in his wallet are stored
in decreasing order with respect to their value. At every point in time Ray wants to be able to add and remove notes from
his wallet, without ruining his perfectly organized system. In addition he wants to know at any time whether he has enough
money in his wallet, for his future purchase. 

- Your first task here is to implement the `add`, `remove` and `contains` methods in order to satisfy Ray's needs and requirements. <br>

After using his newly built by you wallet, Ray realized that his perfect organization is in fact not so perfect. He marked 
the following trend: Whenever he removed a note from his wallet, in 75% of the cases the next note he needed was of the same
value. Since he knows that you are all about efficiency he asks you to implement yet another method, that will save him 
even more time.

- Your second task is to implement the method `remove_mtf`, which will move all remaining notes, of the same value as the one 
that was just removed, to the front so they are more easily accessed by Ray.
