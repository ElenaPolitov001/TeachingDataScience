### Why These Challenges? Because International Programming Contests!

The [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) of 2019](https://icpc.baylor.edu) will be held in Porto, Portugal.
In order to participate in this contest, one must go through a series of preliminaries: the [Delft Algorithm Programming Contest (DAPC)](https://wisv.ch/chipcie/), the [Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC)](https://bapc.eu/), and the [North-West European Regional Contest (NWERC)](https://nwerc.eu).
These preliminaries have already passed, and Maarten Sijm (one of our TAs) went to the NWERC on 24-25 November with the team "<span class=text-nowrap>\\(\Omega(\\)![duck](https://i.gyazo.com/365b541054673d0eac3b7f9a360a7da9.png)\\(^n)\\)</span>" in order to try and get a spot in the world finals at ICPC.

The exercises on these international contests are usually very advanced and most of them can only be solved with knowledge you gain further on in your studies.
That's why at the TU Delft, every year the Freshmen Programming Contest (FPC) is organized, where **you** can participate!
The exact date of this contest is yet unknown (it will most likely be in the beginning of Q4), but you can already start practicing.

Although historically most of the participants to these competitions are Computer Science students, we believe that you can easily beat them.
Usually, several of the problems are mathematical in nature and ideally a team features both Computer Scientists and Mathematicians to excel at all types of problems.
Maarten's team also consisted of a mix between Computer Scientists and Mathematicians, which is likely one of the reasons they have been doing very well on these contests.

The Weekly Programming Challenges that you will find here, are directly copied from exercises from the previous editions of the FPC.
We will try to match the knowledge gained during the course with the difficulty of the challenges as good as possible.
During the actual contests, you will also see exercises that require advanced algorithmic tricks, but there will definitely be some that can be solved using just the knowledge of this course.

While you can find mathematical formulas and other algorithms on the internet in order to solve the problems, note that you will not have internet access during the actual contest!
However, you will be allowed to bring documentation on paper (e.g. a book on Python programming, or a list of algorithms that you picked and printed yourself, [like this open-source example](https://github.com/alexjbest/icpc-tcr/blob/master/teamref.pdf)).

### How Do The Challenges Work?

On the contest, your test data will be passed via the standard input stream (`sys.stdin`) and you should write your output on the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`).
You can usually solve exercises by reading input with for example `input()` or `sys.stdin.readline()`, and printing your output using `print()`.

Each exercise has a set of visible examples (listed in the description and visible in the "Test" tab) and secret test cases (which will be used by the Spec-Tests).
For the visible test cases, you will be able to see the full output of your program.
For the spec-tests, you will not directly see how many of the tests you have passed. Instead, you will roughly see what you are able to see during the contest:

- During the contest, your solution is marked as "RuntimeError" if it raises an exception in at least one of the test cases.
  On WebLab, this will be denoted with the spec-test score `0/3`.
- During the contest, your solution is marked as "WrongAnswer" if it fails for at least one of the test cases.
  On WebLab, this will be denoted with the spec-test score `1/3`.
- During the contest, your solution is marked as "TimeLimitExceeded" if it takes too long to compute the answer in at least one of the test cases.
  On WebLab, this will be denoted with the spec-test score `2/3`.
- During the contest, your solution is marked as "Accepted" if it passes all test cases.
  On WebLab, this will be denoted with the spec-test score `3/3`.

Note that for none of these cases, you will be able to see what data is passed to you for the secret test cases.

### It Ain't No Challenge If You Ain't Got Rankings

For all these challenges, we will enable the "Leaderboard" feature in WebLab.
At this Leaderboard, you can see when the first correct submissions have been done, as well as the submissions with the least amount of attempts.
By default, your submission will be listed as anonymous, but you can choose to have your name displayed publicly at the Leaderboard.

### Help, I'm Stuck!

Since these exercises are challenges, you can expect little help from the TAs.
This is either because they have never seen the exercise before and don't know how to solve it, or because they should be helping other people with the regular course material (which is what they have been hired for).
In case you run into technical problems while solving the exercises, try to find the TA named Maarten Sijm during the Friday labs.
If time allows, you can also talk with him about what these contests are like :)

- [x] I have read the explanation
- [x] I will have fun! :D
