Implement the function `minmax` that finds the minimum and maximum value of a list of integers.
Do this in a _recursive_ way and make sure to traverse the list **only once**. You can assume the list is not empty.

IMPORTANT: In an exam setting, your code will be manually checked to see if you have actually implemented
the function recursively. If you  implemented it iteratively, your grade will be overridden to 1.
