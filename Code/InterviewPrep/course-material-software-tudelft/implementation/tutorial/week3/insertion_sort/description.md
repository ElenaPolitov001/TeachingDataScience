You have just finished the course Algorithms and Data structures exam, you and your friends decide to play some card games.

As your friends are quite lazy, you always end up being the person who has to deal the cards. While you are dealing the cards, your friends are already sorting their own hand. Afterwards, they can complain about how slow you are with sorting your hand.

Having had enough of their complaints, you decide to turn to some algorithms. You would like to use an algorithm to sort your hand, in such a way that it would just look like a human sorting their hand.

For this task you turn to `insertion sort`, you have to implement the function `sort`, which will sort the cards in your hand in a descending order. To make your life easier, you have decided to give every card a number, such that you will only have to deal with sorting numbers.
