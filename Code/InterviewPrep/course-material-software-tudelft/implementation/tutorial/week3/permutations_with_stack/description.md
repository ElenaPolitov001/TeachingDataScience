You have recently been spending too much money when enjoying your student life, thus you have decided to take a part time job in your local fast food restaurant, otherwise you won't have enough money to buy dinner.

The manager of the fast food restaurant knows that you have some experience with programming, and she decides to ask you to help her out. 

She would like to find out what the perfect burger would be, she knows which ingredients she would like to use, however she isn't sure about the correct order in which the burger should be stacked. 

Do we first add the lettuce, followed by the burger, finished by a slice of cheese, or do we put the lettuce after the burger and cheese?

The manager would like you to come up with an algorithm that would showcase all possible permutations of this burger.

However there is a catch to it, as the manager has spent some of her free time to read up about programming, she has stumbled on stacks. She was completely fascinated by this data structure and would like you to use stacks to implement your algorithm. As she argues that a stack looks like a burger...

Your task is now to implement the function `permutations`, this function takes as input a list of strings, and it returns a set of tuples. Where each tuple is a permutation of the initial list.

            To create a tuple of a list, you can use <code>tuple(l)</code>, where <code>l</code> is a list.

            You may want to use two stacks.
