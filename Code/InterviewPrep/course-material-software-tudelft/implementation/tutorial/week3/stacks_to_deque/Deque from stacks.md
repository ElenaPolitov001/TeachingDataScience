In this exercise you have to create a `deque` from 2 `stack`s.

In the library you will find the implementation for the `Stack` class and two instances of these are added to the `Deque` in `__init__`.
You cannot use any other data structure for this exercise.

Implement the given functions in the `Deque` class. The comments describe what the functions should do.
You can use the given test cases to test your code and derive what the functions should do.
