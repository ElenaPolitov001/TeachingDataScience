Remember the time in high school when your teacher would announce the grades for a test, by reading them out loud starting from the top of the list, all the way to the bottom of the list.

For once we would like to announce the grades starting from the names starting with `z`, instead of `a`. However as we are used to reading from top to bottom, we do not want to take the effort to do the opposite now. So instead we decide to create a function that will give us this new ordering of the list.

However, as the names are stored in a singly linked list, we cannot traverse from the end back to the beginning. So instead, we will have to reverse this list.

Which means that you will have to implement the function `reverse`, this function will reverse our singly linked list and make sure that it is still a proper singly linked list, as we do not want to break other functionalities in the system.
