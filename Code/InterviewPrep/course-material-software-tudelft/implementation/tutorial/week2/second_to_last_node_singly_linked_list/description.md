Your company has recently set up a new policy, the last person to arrive at work has to treat everyone to lunch. 

The sole developer, Billy, in your company is a true computer scientist and stays up late every single day. Which inevitably means that he is always the last person to arrive. At first he thought that this was fine, treating people to lunch can help him get closer to his colleagues, after all. 

Only later on did he notice that the company has more than 900 employees. If he had to treat every single one of them to lunch every day, he would be better off filing for bankruptcy.

However as he was the sole developer in the whole company, he was also the person in charge of the system that keeps track of when people arrive at work. He noticed that this was implemented with a singly linked list, now his boss asked him to give an easy way to get the last person on that list. Billy knows that it will be him every single day, if he were to implement this as he was told to. So he decided to play around with it a bit. Instead of the last person in the singly linked list, he will return the second to last person in this last.

Now as Billy has no clue how to implement this, even though he is the sole developer of this big company, you will have to implement this function, `second_to_last_node`, that returns the second to last node in a singly linked list.
