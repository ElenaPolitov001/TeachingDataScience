Implement the function `breadth_first` that returns the values in graph `g` in breadth first order, starting from node `n`.

In the library you will find implementations for the `Graph` and `Node` classes. Each node stores its neighbours.

If a certain node has multiple neighbours, these nodes should be returned in ascending order of their values. The function `get_neighbours` in the library class `Graph` already returns the neighbours in ascending order of their values.
