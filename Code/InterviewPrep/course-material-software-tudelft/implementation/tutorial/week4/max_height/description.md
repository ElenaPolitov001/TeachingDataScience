As we all live in the Netherlands we have the small disadvantage of not having marvelous, high mountains. Because of this small
 limitation we cannot enjoy the beautiful and breathtaking views from up high. However, you are determined to not let your 
 geographical location control your life and figured out a way to enjoy the next sunset from the highest point in nature that
 you can find. What is a better place than the tallest tree in Gelderland. You already know that that's the province with 9 out
 of the 10 highest trees in the Netherlands all you have to do is pick the correct one. In order to choose the best fit for 
 your task you need to calculate the height of each tree. To your advantage is the fact that all the trees in Gelderland are
 binary, meaning that each node can heave at most 2 branches (left and right respectively). Implement the function `max_height`
 which will help you with your desire to enjoy the nice views from above.
