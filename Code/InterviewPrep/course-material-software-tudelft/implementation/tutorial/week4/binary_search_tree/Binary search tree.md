In this exercise you will implement searching in a binary search tree.

In the library you will find the implementation for the `BinaryTree` class. You have to implement the `search` function, which returns whether or not a given integer is in the `BinaryTree`. Return `True` if it is in the tree, otherwise `False`.

Note:

- The left and right child of a `BinaryTree` are trees themselves.
- All tested instances of the `BinaryTree` class are binary search trees with values smaller than or equal to the value of the given node in the left subtree, larger values in the right subtree.
- Your solution must have a worst case time complexity of \\(\mathcal{O}(h)\\) where \\(h\\) is the height of the tree.
