In this exercise you will get three code snippets, you will have to analyse the runtime complexity of each of these code snippets and give the tightest bound runtime complexity in Big-Oh notation.

You do not have to give a formal proof, however you should explain your answer, by stating the recurrence equation with its corresponding base case, and derive the closed form. 

For your recurrence equation and its corresponding base case, you should explain each term of the equation, by referring to parts of the code snippet.

For the closed form you are advised to derive the closed form, by unfolding the recurrence equation at least once.
