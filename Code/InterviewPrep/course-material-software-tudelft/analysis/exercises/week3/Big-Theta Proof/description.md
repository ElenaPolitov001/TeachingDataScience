Given the following two functions:
$$
f(n) = 3n (4n + \sqrt{n})\\\\
g(n) = 2n^2
$$
show that \\(f(n)\\) is \\(\Theta(g(n))\\).

You should state the mathematical relationship that \\(f(n)\\) and \\(g(n)\\) must have and show that it holds.
Remember that, unlike with Big-Oh or Big-Omega proofs, there is now a two-part relationship that needs to be proven.
