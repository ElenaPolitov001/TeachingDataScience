You are given a string containing a wide range of bracket combinations using the following kinds “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]”.
Your task is to verify that the given string expression `s` is a valid balanced bracket expression, meaning that
there is no opening bracket without a matching closing one and vice versa, a closing bracket of one kind is always
to the right of it's corresponding opening bracket and in between any set of matching brackets the before mentioned
rules apply. For example "{[(])}" is not a valid balanced matching, whereas "{{[[(())]]}}" is. Your task is to conclude
whether the given string is a balanced bracket match or not. Given that information what data structure would you use 
to solve the problem and why?
