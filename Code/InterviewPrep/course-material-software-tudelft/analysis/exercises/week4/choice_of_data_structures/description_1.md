You are the manager of the famous ADS (Amazing Doings Store). For you the customers are really important and you want to keep their
satisfaction every time they come to the shop. Unfortunately you don't have a lot of staff members and sometimes shoppers
need to wait until one of the assistants is free. You value highly your regular customers and thus you want to make sure
that they wait as little time as possible, compared to the other non-regular customers. What data structure would you use 
to keep track of the next person to be served and why?
