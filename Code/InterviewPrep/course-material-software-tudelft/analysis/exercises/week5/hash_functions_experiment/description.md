So far, we the analysis part of the homework has been very theoretical, looking at code and determining the bounds by analysing the code by hand.
This week, we would like to give you a chance to get your hands dirty in a more experimental study of run times.
Rather than reason about the run time of an algorithm, we are going to measure its performance and see if this matches our expectations.
To help you out with your first set of experiments in the field of Computer Science, we have provided most of the code.
It is now up to you to do the experiments and verify our claims on the importance of a good hash function when using hash tables.

In this experiment, you will implement several hash functions for strings and compare their performance when used in hash tables.

You should write a small report about your experiment.
You can find instructions for this report in the "Report" exercise.

You can use the code we provided in the "Code" exercise to do the experiment.
There, you will also find instructions to run the experiment on your own machine.
