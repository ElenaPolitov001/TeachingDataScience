In the provided code, you will find the following:

- A `HashTable` class, that you can use to do the experiment.
- Three empty hash functions, that you should implement before doing the experiment.
- A function that generates a heck load of strings.
- A function that builds an experiment to pass to the `timeit.Timer`.
  Inside this function, you should write the code that should be timed for the experiment.
- An incomplete `main` function.
  We gave you the code to do the experiment, but you can set the parameters yourself.
  The `TODO` comments indicate where you can change the parameters for the experiment.

We do not recommend to do the experiment on WebLab, as you will likely hit the timeout of 20 seconds quite easily.
Instead, you can copy this code to your local machine and run it from there.

After you are done with the experiment, please copy your code back in WebLab, so we can also give feedback directly on the code and on the correspondence between your report and your code.
