For the code snippet below, express the time complexity in terms of a polynomial representation.
Simplify your polynomial representation to derive the time complexity in Big Oh notation.

```python
def search(xs: Iterable[T], e: T):
    for x in xs:
        if x == e:
            return True
    return False
```
