Given are 3 different recurrence equation and their corresponding base case. 

For the first two recurrence equations you are asked to give the corresponding closed form and complexity in Big-Oh notation, you do not need to give a proof for these two.

For the last recurrence equation, you are asked to derive the closed form, as well as to prove that this is the correct closed form. 
To derive the closed form you have to repeatedly unfold the recurrence equation, for this part we suggest to at least show two steps of unfolding, e.g. at least for \\(T(n-1)\\) and \\(T(n-2)\\). 
To prove that you indeed derived the correct closed form, you have to do a proof by induction, make sure to be clear in your proofs.
