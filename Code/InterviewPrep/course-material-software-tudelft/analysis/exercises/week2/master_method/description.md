Solve the given recurrence equations using the Master Method as explained in class. Give all relevant
variables and dependencies and all necessary explanation.

- Equation 1:
\\(T(n) = 3T(n/2) + n\\)

- Equation 2:
\\(T(n) = T(n/7) + n\\)

- Equation 3:
\\(T(n) = 2T(n/2) + nlog(n)\\)

- Equation 4:
\\(T(n) = 9T(n/3) + n^2\\)

- Equation 5:
\\(T(n) = \sqrt2T(n/2) + log(n)\\)
