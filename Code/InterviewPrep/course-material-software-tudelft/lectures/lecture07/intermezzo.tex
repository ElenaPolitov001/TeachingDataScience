		\item Rough estimate of CSE first year, so far:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 12 MC forms for 800 people
				\item 8 open question booklets for 800 people (2 sheets of paper each), assume everyone uses only one.
				\item 17 exams for 800 people, lets estimate that at 8 sheets each.
			\end{itemize}
			\pause
		\item	That's roughly 130-thousand sheets of paper.
			\pause
		\item Which is about 1.5 trees, according to howstuffworks.com
	\end{itemize}
