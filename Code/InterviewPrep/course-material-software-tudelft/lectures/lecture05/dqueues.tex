	In python we can use a \texttt{deque} called \texttt{d} on which:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can \textit{push} with \texttt{d.append}.
		\item We can \textit{pop} with \texttt{d.pop}.
		\item We can \textit{top} with \texttt{d[-1]}
			\pause
		\item We can \textit{enqueue} with \texttt{d.append}.
		\item We can \textit{dequeue} with \texttt{d.popleft}.
		\item We can \textit{peek} with \texttt{d[0]}
			\pause
		\item Oh yeah and if you want, you can also add to the left with \texttt{appendleft}
	\end{itemize}
