	\begin{itemize}
		\item Grading of week 1. Sorry we were so late!
		\item We hope to be a lot earlier this week!
			\pause
		\item I will try to generate hand-out versions of my slides as well (less clicking/scrolling).
		\item My slides always end with what sections of the book they correspond to :)
			\pause
		\item FBF fixed the broken links, but now other stuff seems to be broken..
			\pause
		\item You have only a few more days to register for the exams!
		\item Two practice exams will be available by the end of the week (one analysis, one implementation).
			\pause
		\item Again, remember that you can render TeX in WebLab.
