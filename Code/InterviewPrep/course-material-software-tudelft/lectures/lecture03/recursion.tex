		Why might we like to use recursion to solve some problems?

		\small
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In ``Discrete Mathematics with Applications'' (a book we used to use in Computer Science), the author
				describes recursion as: ``one of the central ideas in computer science''.
			\pause
			\vspace{-5pt}
			\item A nice (mathematical?) construct: problems can often be reduced to smaller sub problems.
			\pause
			\vspace{-5pt}
			\item Parallelisation: make one problem two smaller problems that separate computers can solve.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{alertblock}{So should we use it for everything? No!}
			\small
			In the homework, we force you to use it on problems where iteration makes more sense.\\
			This is unfortunate, but needed to practice.
