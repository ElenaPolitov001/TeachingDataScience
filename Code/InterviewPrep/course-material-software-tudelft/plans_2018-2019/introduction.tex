\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document offers an overview of the course design for Algorithms \& Datastructures for Mathematics students
(TI1520TW). The
course is a total of 6 ECTS and is offered in Q3 as an elective to the Applied Mathematics students. Any programming
done for this course is done in the Python programming language.
We use the book ``Data Structures \& Algorithms in Python'' by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
for this course.
