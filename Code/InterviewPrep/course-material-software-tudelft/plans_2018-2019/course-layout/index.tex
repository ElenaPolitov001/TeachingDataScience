\section{Course layout}
\label{sec:course_layout}

In this section we describe the new course layout, focusing on what learning objectives are covered in the different
lectures, homeworks, and exams.

Table~\ref{tab:schedule} provides an overview of the lecturing schedule for the course, each lecture is discussed in
more detail below, where we also describe what the tutorial and assignments are for the corresponding week. For every
lecture and tutorial there is a lesson plan, including learning objectives, the intermezzo topic (in case of lectures),
and how much time is spent on different topics. For every weekly assignment there is also an indicated amount of time
students are expected to spend on them.

\begin{table}[htpb]
	\centering
	\caption{The course schedule, vertical lines indicate which material is tested in the exam in the week after that
	lecture. E.g. The line after lecture 8 indicates all material up to lecture 8 can be tested in the exam in week 5.}
