# Interview Preparation

## Rational
- Big gap: lots of openings and lots of unemployment. Is it just a skills-mismatch or the assessment process itself is not tuned on both sides?
- Reality: Companies can have just a few hours decide/select, which means proxies are needed for assessing fitments. 
- Proxies across most companies are pretty standard (and no-brainers):
	- General: academics, relevance of past experience, behavioral
	- IT: @General + Data structures & algorithms, System Design
	- DataScience: @IT + Machine/Deep Learning
- Precision over Recall: as getting a wrong candidate is consider more expensive (firing is hard), precision is preferred. Thus long-thorough hiring process
- Need curated resources for preparing such standard interviews (even 6-7 rounds in some cases), and thats what this page attempts to cater to ...
