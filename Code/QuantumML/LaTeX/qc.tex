The tensor product of the Hilbert spaces for the individual qubits is the appropriate model for these entangled systems.	\item For example, if we have two qubits with bases $\{\ket 0_1,\ket 1_1\}$ and	$\{ \ket 0_2,\ket 1_2\}$ respectively, the tensor product space has the basis 	$$\{\ket 0_1\tensor\ket 0_2,\ket 0_1\tensor\ket 1_2,\ket 1_1\tensor\ket 0_2,\ket 1_1\tensor\ket 1_2\}.$$  We can (conveniently) denote this basis as$$\{\ket{00},\ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}\}.$$\end{itemize}\end{slide}%Slide 16\begin{slide}{}\begin{itemize}	\item More generally, if we have $n$ qubits to which we can apply common measurements, we will be working in the $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space with basis$$\{\ket{00\ldots00},\ket{00\ldots01},\ldots,\ket{11\ldots10},\ket{11\ldots11}\}$$\item A typical quantum state for an $n$-qubit system is$$\sum_{i = 0}^{2^n-1}a_i\ket i$$where $a_i\in\complex$, and $\{\ket i\}$ is the basis, with (in our notation) $i$ written as an $n$-bit binary number.\end{itemize}\end{slide}%Slide 17\begin{slide}{}\begin{itemize}\item A classical (macroscopic) physical object broken into pieces can be described and measured as separate components.An $n$-particle quantum system cannot always bedescribed in terms of the states of its component pieces. For instance, the state \newline$\ket{00}+\ket{11}$ cannot be decomposed into separate statesof each of the two qubits.  In other words, we cannot find $a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2$ such that $$(a_1\ket 0 + b_1\ket 1)\tensor (a_2\ket 0 + b_2\ket 1) = \ket{00}+\ket{11}$$since $$(a_1\ket 0 + b_1\ket 1)\tensor (a_2\ket 0 + b_2\ket 1) = $$$$  a_1a_2\ket{00} + a_1b_2\ket{01} + b_1a_2\ket{10} + b_1b_2\ket{11}$$ and$a_1b_2 = 0$ implies that either $a_1a_2 = 0$ or $b_1b_2 = 0$.States which cannot be decomposed in this way are called entangled\index{entangled} states.These are states that don't have classical counterparts, andfor which our intuition is likely to fail.\end{itemize}\end{slide}%Slide 18\begin{slide}{}\begin{itemize}\item Particles are entangled if a measurement of oneaffects a measurement of the other. For example, the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{11})$ is entangled since the probability of measuring the first bit as $\ket 0$ is $1/2$ if the second bit has not been measured. However, if the second bithas been measured, the probability that the first bit is measured as $\ket 0$ is either $1$ or $0$, depending on whether thesecond bit was measured as $\ket 0$ or $\ket 1$, respectively. On the other hand, the state$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{01})$ is not entangled. Since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00}+\ket{01}) = \ket 0\tensor \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$, any measurement of the first bit will yield $\ket 0$ regardless ofmeasurements of the second bit.  Similarly, the second bit has a fifty-fifty chance of being measured as $\ket 0$ regardless of measurements of the first bit. Note that entanglement in terms of particle measurement dependence is equivalent to the definition of entangledstates as states that cannot be written as a tensor product of individualstates.\end{itemize}\end{slide}%Slide 19\begin{slide}{}\sectionhead{Quantum Computing}\begin{itemize}	\item This exponential growth in number of states, together with the ability to subject the entire space to transformations (either unitary dynamical evolution of the system, or a measurement projection into an eigenvector subspace), provides the foundation for quantum computing.	\item An interesting (apparent) dilemma is the energetic costs/irreversability of classical computing.  Since unitary transformations are invertible, quantum computations (except measurements) will all be reversible.  The classical boolean operations such as $b_1\land b_2$, $b_1\lor b_2$, and $b_1\lnandb b_2$ are irreversible, and therefore cannot directly be used as basic operations for quantum computers.\end{itemize}\end{slide}%Slide 20\begin{slide}{}\begin{itemize}	\item The logical nand-gate ($b_1\lnandc b_2$) is sufficient to generate all the traditional boolean functions (e.g., $\sim\negmedspace b \equiv b\ \lnanda b$).
