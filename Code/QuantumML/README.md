### QnA with Himanshu Vaidya
Q - Why do a ML Engineering has to bother about underlying hardware, it can be CPU, GPU, TPU or QPU?
A - QPU is not an improved and similar replaceable processor. Quantum computing paradigm itself is very different than normal computing. The classical computing is based on bits (0s, 1s) where is Quantum is on Qubits. This data type definitions, the data storage methodologies are very different. The abstractions are not yet developed to make QPU replaceable.

Q - How practical is it to use Quantum Computing for ML?
A - Not all ML problems can be solved using Quantum. Similar to parallel processing paradigm, where problems themselves are split to be parallel, some problems themselves have to be quantumiz-able. Even with 70 qubits, with overlapping/superimpose storage, huge simulations can be solved.
