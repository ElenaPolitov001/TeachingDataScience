# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

## Introduction
Current Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Classifier, Naïve Bayes, etc. expect independent features. That’s rarely the case, especially for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. The dataset itself is in form of graph, ie, nodes and arcs as relations, such as social networks, molecules, graphics meshes, etc.  Sparse or Dense embeddings used in ML of NLP, are related to each other contextually, albeit linearly ie 1D convolution like. Thus, traditional ML algorithms do not learn the representation (underlying structure) well and demand need of an inter-dependent representation system such as Graph Neural Networks.
