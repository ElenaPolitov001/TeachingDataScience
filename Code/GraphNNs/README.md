# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

## Introduction
Graphs, though omnipresent, had shied away from being in Machine Learning domain, in the past.

The reason is, they are different. They are unstructured. Unlike popular tabular (fixed rows and columns) and images (fixed length, width, and channels) data, graphs have variable number of nodes and edges, making them unsuitable as an input to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. ML needs fixed-dimensioned-vectorized-features. Now, various approaches are getting devised to embed/vectorize graphs as well.


## Potential
- Relatively new and upcoming domain
- Widely applicable: Social Networks, logistics, molecular biology, mesh graphics, etc.
- Active research in Big companies, with scale in FAANG
- Usable in MidcurveNN, skeletons, Meshes, applicable in point-clouds for AR/VR,
- IKIGAI, Specific Knowledge, unique for Consultations
- Work experience, with scale, in NLP, Graph pre-training, Knowledge Graph generation, etc
- Aim for publications in MidcurveNN as well as Contracts KG
