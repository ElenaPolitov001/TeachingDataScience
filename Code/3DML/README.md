# 3D Machine/Deep Learning

## Rational
- Big demand: AR/VR in many domains like manufacturing, health, architecture, media & entertainment.
- Reality: Computer vision (2D) domain is well established but not 3D (many representations like, point cloud, mesh, implicit surface equations, voxels, primitives, etc)
- Potential: Big push by Meta, Nvidia, Google, etc on Machine/Deep Learning on 3D data. Large number of research/commercial/individual opportunities. 

## Why me?
- Over 2 decades of professional experience in 3D modeling software development along with Masters and Doctoral degrees.
- Over half-a-decade of professional/teaching experience in Machine/Deep Learning.


## IKIGAI 
- World needs: huge demand, unique combination of 3D+ML needed forever!!
- Good at: both domains, got PhD, taught these subjects, vast experience
- Love doing: Wow projects in visualization, 3D and Pytorch
- Paid for: FAANG, $$$, Own, global impact, conferences, global reach

## Specific Knowledge 
	- rare, un-trainable, 
	- only through apprenticeship/experience, 
	- unique ability of domain expertise plus teaching/counseling, 
	- be a reliable brand!!
