# Interview Preparation

## Rational
- Big gap: lots of openings and lots of unemployment. Is it just a skills-mismatch or the assessment process itself is not tuned on both sides?
- Reality: Companies can have just a few hours decide/select, which means proxies are needed for assessing fitments. Precision over Recall.
- Proxies:
	- General: academics, relevance of past experience, behavioral
	- IT: Data structures & algorithms, System Design
	- DataScience: @General + @IT + Machine/Deep Learning

This site will elaborate on @IT and @DataScience.
