# Courses And Talks

तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय : From Dark (hidden in text data) to Light (insights)

## Rational
- Global Recognition and getting opportunities and respect (Part II, 40+, chalk in hand)
- For Giving back from classes to masses, dyan-eshwar. 
- If any $: Donate [CoEP Alumni, Jagriti, Aai for causes]
- For better own understanding

## IKIGAI/Specific Knowledge^/Wow^^!!: 
- World needs: huge sustainable-global need-demand for teaching
- Good at: Professional-teaching experience,PhD, Rasa Hero-Certified, GDE ML
- Love doing: teaching, part II of life, giving back, up-leveling Bottom-of-Pyramid
- Paid for: good-simple explanations, passive service

^Specific Knowledge: rare, un-trainable, only through apprenticeship 
^^Not looking for Success, but for Wonder


## ToDos (Create, not just consume):
- Upgrade Rasa tex with 3.0,using docs, vidoes, mds, notebooks
- Add quizzs, exervices and more ML explanations
- Learn OBS, make checklist, learn video recording-editing, setup studio
- Use cartoon for explanatory sketches (USP)
- Pick niche topics (Rasa 3.0 to start), later landing consultancy
- Build from home for good passive income, sustainable forever
- Platform: Udemy then Coursera, advt on linkedin or Rasa channel/community


## Talks Playbook
Avenues: @TFUG Pune, Colleges/Confs, GDE speakers opportunities
Logistics:
- Day/time: Saturdays Mornings, 9 to 10 am, else NO
- Pre-Talk (somewhat TFUG specific), but can be adopted elsewhere):
    - Prep materials `_seminar.tex` and `ipynb` for 40 minutes talk and then QnA
    - Create Google calendar event with Google Meet link
    - Create Banner png from `Talks/TFUG_Banner_Template.ppt`
		- Create TFUG Pune Meetup event with Google Meet link and Banner png, good intro text
    - Advertise the Meetup link: my LinkedIn, Company Teams, GDE WhatsApp groups
    - Copy material `Talks` folder, github sync
		- No recording or YouTube streaming, content is open-sourced anyway
- During Talk: [Simplify with Doodles (?, tablet)]
    - Take pictures or screenshots
    - At the end of the talk, 
- Post-Talk:
    - Fill GDE Advocu entry with picture taken
    - Fill GDE New event survey link
    - Share beamer pdf of the talk on meetup, post pictures there

## Courses Playbook
- Using OBS: Open-source Free-ware
	- Sources: Windows Capture
	- Settings:
		- Hot Keys: Alt + 10 to start recording, Alt + F11 to stop
		- Output format : mkv, easier to mix, can be converted to mp4 by File->Remux
		- Output gets stored in Videos folder
- OpenShot to edit video, save to join
- Handbrake to compress video
