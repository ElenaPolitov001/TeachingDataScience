\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Benefits of Combining Knowledge Graphs and LLMs}

\begin{itemize}
\item LLMs:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  Hallucinate.
	\item   Have general knowledge.
	\item   Understand natural language.
	\item   Do not provide structured responses.
	\end{itemize}

\item KGs:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item   Do not understand language.
	\item   Provide structured responses.
	\item   Are accurate and interpretable.
	\item   Have domain-specific knowledge.
	\end{itemize}

\item LLMs+KGs have the potential to overcome some of the weaknesses of LLMs.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chain of Thought:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item LLM determines necessary steps
	\item Executes them sequentially
	\end{itemize}
	
\item Tree of Thought:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Combines thought with symbolic tree search algorithm
	\item Enables optimal 'thought path' selection
	\item Advances LLM's planning complexity
	\end{itemize}
	
\item Graph of Thought:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Thoughts modeled as nodes connected by edges
	\item Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) used
	\item Revolutionizes data pipeline orchestration
	\item Models dependencies without circular loops
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
