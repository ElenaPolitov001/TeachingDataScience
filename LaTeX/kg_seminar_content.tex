%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Problem Statement}

\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional job recommendation systems are based on simple keyword and/or semantic similarity that are usually not well suited to providing good job recommendations since they donâ€™t take into account the interlinks between entities. 
\item It is of utmost importance to have field-relevant skills listed on your resume and to uncover which industry skills are becoming more pertinent.
\item For instance, I might have extensive skills in Python programming, but the job description of interest requires knowledge in Django framework, which is essentially based on Python; a simple keyword search will miss that connection.
\item Build a job recommendation and skill discovery script that will take unstructured text as input, and will then output job recommendations and skill suggestions based on entities such as skills, years of experience, diploma, and major

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Choice}

\begin{itemize}
\item PoC: possible with NER and python library networkX, but its limited as the whole graphs stays in memory. Cant scale.
\item Need graph database, say, Neo4j.
\item Can store large amounts of data (nodes, edges) and has intuitive query language called, Cypher.

\begin{itemize}
\item How to leverage transformers based NER and spacyâ€™s relation extraction models to create knowledge graph with Neo4j.
\item In addition to information extraction, the graph topology can be used as an input to another machine learning model.
