\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction}
A pattern matching query language made for graphs

\begin{itemize}
\item Declarative: say, what you want? and not how to search for the answer (Imperative)
\item Expressive
\item Pattern-Matching : ASCI Art

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Use Case}

Movie Dataset

\begin{itemize}
\item The graph contains nodes with the labels Person and Movie. 
\item Person nodes have several types of relationships to Movie nodes. 
\item A Person node can have a FOLLOWS relationship to another Person node.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Representation}


\begin{itemize}
\item Nodes are represented in round brackets \lstinline|()|
\item Relationships are represented as arrow with its label in square bracket in between \lstinline|-[]->|
\item \lstinline|(variable:label)|

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Retrieval}


\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern specification for MATCH command, to retrieve data in graph.
\item Find and return person $p$ and movie $m$
\item First finds $p$ with given name, then goes to all relationships with given type and then finds $m$ which matches given title.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Absence of a property can also be checked in WHERE clause
\item Partial matches are allowed using STARTS\_WITH, ENDS\_WITH keywords
\item String tests are case sensitive, so better to LOWER them.
\item Check presence IN a list

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Aggregates}
No need to specify grouping key. There is no group-by statement. Other Aggregates are SUM, STDDEV, etc.


\begin{lstlisting}
// implicitly groups by p.name
MATCH (p.Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, count(*) AS numberOfMovies

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Nodes}

\begin{itemize}
\item MERGE: Creates a new node if not present already. All subsequent calls do not do anything as node with said properties is already present.

\item CREATE: Will create multiple nodes even if nodes with similar properties are present already
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Relationships}

\begin{itemize}
\item First get two existing nodes between which a relationship needs to be created.
\item Same MERGE logic is there for Relationships as well.
item Relationship type must begin with ':'

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use SET to set new or existing properties
\item It can be used for both Nodes and Relationships
\item Use REMOVE to remove a property. (it should not be a primary key though)

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conditionals}

\begin{itemize}
\item ON CREATE will do the SET at the time of creation, ie first time when the node is created. There ON MATCH wont run.
\item Next time, when the whole code is executed again, ON CRETAE wont run, but ON MATCH will.

\item Just get the reference to the object and delete it.
\item It can be a Node (if dangling) or a Relationship.
\item DETACH DELETE removes all relationships from the node and then DELETEs it.
\item To delete all nodes, just say \lstinline|MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n|
