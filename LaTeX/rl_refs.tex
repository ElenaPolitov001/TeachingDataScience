As you have come so far, lets see if you can solve the following:

\begin{itemize}
% \item How would you find a minimum of $y=e^(2 - x) + x^2 - x/2$?
% \item Transformers: can you have 5 attention heads with a sequence length equal to 100 and embedding dimension to 512, and why?
\item Please explain why the Bellman Equation is important and explain how you have used it in your work.
\item DQN RL: how can you use DQN on an environment with 100 unique states, and actions taking values on the interval $[-0.5, 0.5]$?
\end{itemize}
