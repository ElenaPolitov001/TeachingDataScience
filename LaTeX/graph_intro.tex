\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why Graphs? Why Now?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Universal language for describing complex data: Networks/graphs from science, nature, and technology are more similar than one would expect
\item Shared vocabulary between fields: Computer Science, Social science, Physics, Biology, Economics 
\item Data availability (+ computational challenges): Social/Internet, text, logic, program, bio, health, and medical
\item Impact: Social networking, Social media, Drug design, Event detection, Natural language processing, Computer vision, and Logic reasoning
\end{itemize}
