\begin{frame}\frametitle{Graph Components}

\begin{itemize}
\item Node (Vertex): A must data element for constructing a graph
\item Relationship (Edge) : Link between two nodes, can have direction and type.
\item Label: Node category/type such as PERSON, ORG, etc. One node can have many types.
\item Properties: Attributes or fields in Nodes or Edges, eg. A node can have Label PERSON and Property such as ``name: Jane''
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Graph-Edge Types}

\begin{itemize}
\item Undirected graph: edges are bidirectional, e.g. Michale is brother of John, necessarily means that John is brother of Michale.
\item Directed graph: edges have one direction, e.g. A likes B does not necessarily mean that B likes A.
\item Weighted graph: edges have weights, e.g. connection from city A to city B via road R1 will have wright, say, 8, due to high traffic, but via road R2, may have weight 2, due to lower traffic.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Shortest Path}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find shortest path in a weighted graph, to save logistic costs
\item Dijkstra's or A* algorithm
\item Graph Traversals: can edges be traversed multiple times or nodes traversed multiple times? Neo4j prefers not to traverse edges multiple times, thus making it fast.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Universal language for describing complex data: Networks/graphs from science, nature, and technology are more similar than one would expect
\item Shared vocabulary between fields: Computer Science, Social science, Physics, Biology, Economics 
\item Data availability (+ computational challenges): Social/Internet, text, logic, program, bio, health, and medical
\item Impact: Social networking, Social media, Drug design, Event detection, Natural language processing, Computer vision, and Logic reasoning
