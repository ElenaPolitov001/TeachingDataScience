\begin{itemize}
\item Node (Vertex): A must data element for constructing a graph
\item Relationship (Edge) : Link between two nodes, can have direction and type.
\item Label: Node category/type such as PERSON, ORG, etc. One node can have many types.
\item Properties: Attributes or fields in Nodes or Edges, eg. A node can have Label PERSON and Property such as ``name: Jane''

\begin{itemize}
\item Universal language for describing complex data: Networks/graphs from science, nature, and technology are more similar than one would expect
\item Shared vocabulary between fields: Computer Science, Social science, Physics, Biology, Economics 
\item Data availability (+ computational challenges): Social/Internet, text, logic, program, bio, health, and medical
\item Impact: Social networking, Social media, Drug design, Event detection, Natural language processing, Computer vision, and Logic reasoning
