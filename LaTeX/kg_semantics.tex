  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Context Matters}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In Knowledge Graphs, semantics add context to data.
    \item Consider a person named "John" - semantics help distinguish if it's "John Smith" or "John Doe."
    \item By understanding context, insurers gain insights into customer preferences, risks, and more.
    \item Semantics enable personalized customer experiences and targeted insurance products.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Semantic Triplets}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Knowledge Graphs use semantic triplets: Subject - Predicate - Object.
    \item Subject: The entity about which information is stored.
    \item Predicate: The relationship between the subject and the object.
    \item Object: The value or entity related to the subject.
    \item For example, (Ramesh, hasOccupation, Software Engineer) is a semantic triplet.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

{\Large Ontology }
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ontology: onto (existence, real) + logia (study) : most essential existence representation
\item According to Wikipedia, an ontology “encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse.”
\item In other words, ontologies allow us to organize the jargon of a subject area into a controlled vocabulary, thereby decreasing complexity and confusion. 
\item Without ontologies, you have no frame of reference, and understanding is lost.
\item For example, an ontology will allow one to associate the Book taxonomy with the Customer taxonomy via relationships.
\item An ontology is more challenging to create than a taxonomy because it needs to capture the interrelationships between business objects/concepts by encapsulating the language and terminology of the business area you are modeling.
\item Ontologies take taxonomy a step-further, by providing added layers to that relationship that and take it outside of just the product domain to other domains such as customer data and digital assets.   
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Understanding Ontology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ontology is the backbone of Knowledge Graphs, providing a formal, shared understanding of the domain's concepts and relationships.
\item It defines the vocabulary and rules for representing and reasoning about the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
\item In the insurance industry, ontology can capture complex relationships between insurance products, coverage options, and risk factors.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
