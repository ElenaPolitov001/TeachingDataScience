	\item Plotting them on X axis.
	\item The dots would look very crowded where there are many close or repetitive observations.
	\item Some dots get hidden.
	\item We can improve the visualization, by plotting frequency (number of occurrences) on Y axis.
	\item But in case of contiguous variable, like, exact measurements are rare. So we `bin' them and measure occurrences.
	\item Thats Histogram.

The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a continuous, symmetric distribution.

The {\bf standard normal distribution}, denoted $N(0,1)$ is a normal
distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.  The normal distribution
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

From the properties of expected values and standard deviations given earlier:

\begin{itemize}

\item If $Z$ is standard normal, then $\mu + \sigma Z$ is
  $N(\mu,\sigma^2$).

\item If $Z$ is $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $(Z-\mu)/\sigma$ is standard
  normal.

\frametitle{Calculating normal probabilities}

Suppose we have a random variable $T$ which has mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$.  If we are willing to assume $T$ is normal, how
can we calculate $P(T>c)$ for some constant $c$?

Normal probability tables are available on the web and in most
statistics software packages.  Often only a table for the standard
normal distribution is available, but this is sufficient, since

\vspace{-0.5cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(T>c) &=& P((T-\mu)/\sigma > (c-\mu)/\sigma)\\ &=& 1 - P(Z \le
(c-\mu)/\sigma).
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus we can look up the value of $(c-\mu)/\sigma$ in a standard normal
probability, table or use a software package, e.g. in R we would use

\begin{lstlisting}
1 - pnorm((c-mu)/s)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Normal distribution rules of thumb}

\begin{itemize}

\item The normal distribution is symmetric -- around half of a normal
sample lies below the mean and half lies above the mean.

\item Around 68\% of a normal sample lies within one standard
deviation of the mean.  For example, if we have 1000 points from a
normal distribution with mean $10$ and variance $4$, around 680 of the
points will lie between 8 and 12.

\item Around 95\% of a normal sample lies within two standard
  deviations of the mean.  Continuing with the previous example,
  around 950 of the points will lie between 6 and 14.

\item Around 99\% of a normal sample lies within three standard
  deviations of the mean.  Continuing with the previous example,
  around 990 of the points will lie between 4 and 16.

\frametitle{Log transforms}

Some quantities that vary over several orders of magnitude are best
analyzed on the log scale.

For example, if we observe these values:

$$
14,28,3,60,39,13,1,9,3,55
$$

We can take $\log_2$ to get their approximate values as powers of 2:

$$
3.8, 4.8, 1.6, 5.9, 5.3, 3.7, 0, 3.2, 1.6, 5.8.
$$

It usually doesn't matter what base is used, since we can convert from
one base to another by scaling:

$$
\log_b(x) = \log_a(x) / \log_a(b)
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Symmetrizing effect of log transforms}

The log transform symmetrizes right-skewed distributions:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{042-1.pdf}} &
\scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{042-2.pdf}} 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It's common to transform data to make it more symmetric, and usually
that's the right thing to do (but don't overdo it...).


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Properties of log transforms}

Remember the key properties of logarithms: 

$$\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b) \hspace{2cm} \log(a^b) = b\log(a).$$

As a consequence, if we take data $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ and scale it to
get $Z_i = cX_i$, then

$$
\log(Z_1), \ldots, \log(Z_n) = \log(c)+\log(X_1), \ldots, \log(c)+\log(X_n)
$$

Thus changing the units of the original data becomes a shift by
$\log(c)$ units for the log-transformed data.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mean values and log transforms}

If we observe data $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ and take a log transform to get
$Y_i = \log X_i$, then the mean value of the logged data is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{Y} &=& n^{-1}\sum_i Y_i\\
       &=& n^{-1}\sum_i \log X_i\\
       &=& n^{-1}\log(X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_n)\\
       &=& \log\left((X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_n)^{1/n}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

$(X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_n)^{1/n}$ is called the {\bf geometric mean}
of the $X_i$, so we see that the usual (arithmetic) mean of the log
transformed data is the log of the geometric mean of the untransformed
data.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Log transforms}

We generally take the log of positive data that is substantially right
skewed.  If the data are roughly symmetrically distributed, there is
no need to take a log transform, and you cannot take a log transform
if any of the data values are less than or equal to zero.

\textcolor{blue}{\bf Examples:} We generally would log-transform
income but not age.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standardizing the sample mean}

Suppose we have an id sample of $n$ observations from a population
with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

We know that $\bar{X}$ has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$ (so
the standard deviation is $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$).  

The standardized sample mean is

$$
\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \sqrt{n}\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma}.
$$

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Example calculation with the normal distribution}

Suppose we have a sample $X_1, \ldots, X_{20}$ from a normal
population with mean zero.  We are told that the probability that
$|\bar{X}|$ is greater than 1 is 0.2.  What is the standard deviation
of the $X_i$?

Using the fact that the normal distribution is symmetric,

\begin{eqnarray*}
0.2 &=& P(|\bar{X}| > 1)\\ &=& P(\bar{X}>1) + P(\bar{X}<-1)\\ &=&
2P(\bar{X}>1)\\ &=&
2P(\sqrt{20}\bar{X}/\sigma>\sqrt{20}/\sigma)\\ &=& 2P(Z >
\sqrt{20}/\sigma).
\end{eqnarray*}

So $P(Z > \sqrt{20}/\sigma) = 0.1$.  Now if we look at a table of the
normal distribution, we see that the probability of a standard normal
value being bigger than 1.28 is 0.1, so $\sqrt{20}/\sigma = 1.28$, and
$\sigma = \sqrt{20}/1.28 \approx 3.49$.

\item Suppose we observe a sample of 150 values from a normal
 population with mean 80 and standard deviation 12.  Write an R
 expression that will give the approximate number of values between
 75 and 85.

\item Suppose we observe a sample of 200 values from a normal

 observe are greater than 50.  Approximately what is the standard

particular value is, i.e., calculate the value of the ``standard score'' or ``Z-score''.
\item Use the following formula to convert a raw data value, $X$, to a standard score:
$Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}$
\item eg. Suppose a particular population has $\mu= 4$ and $\sigma = 2$. Find the probability of a
randomly selected value being greater than 6
\item The Z score corresponding to $X = 6$ is $Z = \frac{(6 - 4)}{2} = 1$
\item $Z=1$ means that the value $X = 6$ is 1 standard deviation away from the mean
\item Use  standard normal tables to find $P(Z>1) = 0.6587$

\begin{itemize}
\item Draw a diagram, label and shade area required

\item Convert raw score $X$ to standard score $Z$: $Z = \frac{(14.45 - 23.56)}{4.55} = - 2.0$
\item That is, the raw score of 14.45 is equivalent to a standard score of -2.0.
\item It is negative because it is on the left hand side of the curve.
\item Use tables to find probability and adjust this result to required probability: 
\begin{align*}
p(X < 14.45) = p(Z ,-2.0) &= 0.5 - p(0< Z < 2)\\
&= 0.5 - 0.4772\\

\item For $p(Z < z) = 0.05$ the Normal tables give the corresponding z-score as -1.645.
(Negative because it is left of the mean.)
\item Hence the raw score is 
\begin{align*}
X &= Z \times \sigma + \mu\\

\item For a small interval the probability of the event occurring is proportional to the size of the interval.
\item The probability of more than one occurrence in the small interval is negligible (i.e. they are rare events). Events must not occur simultaneously
\item Each occurrence must be independent of others and must be at random.
\item  The events are often defects, accidents or unusual natural happenings, such as
earthquakes, where in theory there is no upper limit on the number of events.
