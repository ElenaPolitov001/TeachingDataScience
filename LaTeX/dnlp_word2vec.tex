\begin{itemize}
\item The training objective is to maximize the conditional probability of observing the actual output word (the focus word) given the input context words, with regard to the weights. 
\item Since our input vectors are one-hot, multiplying an input vector by the weight matrix W1 amounts to simply selecting a row from W1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{CBOW (Continuous Bag of words)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Output at the hidden layer neurons can be computed as: $H^t = X^tW_1 = [-0.490796, -0.229903, 0.065460]$
\item Similarly for hidden to output layer: $H^tW_2$ = {\small[ 0.100934,  -0.309331,  -0.122361,  -0.151399,   0.143463,  -0.051262,  -0.079686,   0.112928]}
\item Since the goal is produce probabilities for words in the output layer, softmax is used
\item Thus, the probabilities for eight words in the corpus are:{\small 0.143073,   0.094925,   0.114441,   0.111166,   0.149289,   0.122874,   0.119431,   0.144800}
\item Error is by subtracting probability vector from the target vector.
\item Once the error is known, the weights in the matrices $W_2$ and $W_1$ can be updated using backpropagation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{CBOW (Continuous Bag of words)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Given C input word vectors, the activation function for the hidden layer h amounts to simply summing the corresponding `hot' rows in W1, and dividing by C to take their average.
\item This implies that the link (activation) function of the hidden layer units is simply linear (i.e., directly passing its weighted sum of inputs to the next layer). 
\item From the hidden layer to the output layer, the second weight matrix W2 can be used to compute a score for each word in the vocabulary, and softmax can be used to obtain the posterior distribution of words.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{CBOW}
Advantages of CBOW:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Being probabilistic is nature, it is supposed to perform superior to deterministic methods(generally).
\item      It is low on memory. It does not need to have huge RAM requirements like that of co-occurrence matrix where it needs to store three huge matrices.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages  of CBOW:
\begin{itemize}
\item  CBOW takes the average of the context of a word (as seen above in calculation of hidden activation). For example, Apple can be both a fruit and a company but CBOW takes an average of both the contexts and places it in between a cluster for fruits and companies.
\item  Training a CBOW from scratch can take forever if not properly optimized.

\begin{itemize}
\item Skip-gram follows the same topology as of CBOW.

\begin{itemize}
\item Since context window is of 1 on both the sides, there will be ``two'' one hot encoded target variables and ``two'' corresponding outputs as can be seen by the blue section in the image.
\item Two separate errors are calculated with respect to the two target variables and the two error vectors obtained are added element-wise to obtain a final error vector which is propagated back to update the weights.
\item The weights between the input and the hidden layer are taken as the word vector representation after training.

\item Matrix multiplication of hidden activation and the hidden output weights. There will be two rows calculated for two target(context) words.
\item Each output is converted into its softmax probabilities
\item Error is calculated for all output
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Skip-Gram Model}
Advantages of Skip-Gram Model
\begin{itemize}
\item Skip-gram model can capture two semantics for a single word. i.e it will have two vector representations of Apple. One for the company and other for the fruit.
\item     Skip-gram with negative sub-sampling outperforms every other method generally.
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages  of  Skip-Gram Model:
\begin{itemize}
\item Very vulnerable, and not a robust concept
\item Can take a long time to train
\item Non-uniform results

	\item Two main architectures: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and the Skip-gram model. 
	\item Simplest version of CBOW: a one-word window. Actual is typically 2 words on left, 2 words on right.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Architecture}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Input Layer:  one-hot encoded vector $x$ of dimension V, where V is the size of the vocabulary.
	\item Hidden Layer: dimension N, decided by us, typically 300.
	\item Output layer: again, one hot representation of output word, so is a vector of dimension V.
    \item Weights Matrix between input and hidden Layer: $W_{V \times N}$
    \item Weights Matrix between hidden and output Layer: $W'_{N \times V}$

\begin{eqnarray*}

\textbf{y}= & \ \ \mathbb{S}\textrm{oftmax}(\textbf{u})= \mathbb{S}\textrm{oftmax}(W'^TW^T\textbf{x})  \hspace{2cm}
\end{eqnarray*}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Target (output) and Context (Input) word pairs: $w_t, w_c$
	\item Output word has $1$ at $j^{th}$ position, say.
	\item  Since the values in the softmax can be interpreted as conditional probabilities of the target word, given the context word 
$w_c$, we write the loss function as:
  \end{itemize}
  
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{L} = -\log \mathbb{P}(w_t|w_c)=-\log y_{j^*}\ =-\log[\mathbb{S}\textrm{oftmax}(u_{j^*})]=-\log\left(\frac{\exp{u_{j^*}}}{\sum_i \exp{u_i}}\right),
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Loss Function}
Finally, loss is:

\begin{equation}
% \bbox[lightblue,5px,border:2px solid red]{
\mathcal{L} = -u_{j^*} + \log \sum_i \exp{(u_i)}.
% }
\label{eq:loss}
\end{equation}

The loss function (Eqn \ref{eq:loss}) is the quantity we want to minimize, given our training example, i.e., we want to maximize the probability that our model predicts the target word, given our context word.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The backpropagation algorithm for the CBOW model}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We want to find the values of $W$ and $W'$ that minimize the loss (Eqn \ref{eq:loss})
	\item Optimization problem is usually tackled using gradient descent
	\item To update the Weight matrices we need to find the derivatives  $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial{W}$ and $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial{W’}$
	\item The derivatives then simply follow from the chain rule for multivariate functions
	



  \end{itemize}

	\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial W'_{ij}} = \sum_{k=1}^V\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial u_k}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial W'_{ij}}
\label{eq:dLdWp}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial W_{ij}} = \sum_{k=1}^V\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial u_k}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial W_{ij}}\ .
\label{eq:dLdW}
\end{equation}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The backpropagation algorithm for the CBOW model}
The weight $W’_{ij}$ which is an element of the matrix $W'$ and connects a node 
$i$ of the hidden layer to a node $j$ of the output layer, 
only affects the output score $u_j$ (and also $y_i$)

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{w2v13}
\end{center} 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The backpropagation algorithm for the CBOW model}
Hence, among all the derivatives $\partial u_k/\partial W'_{ij}$, only the one where $k=j$ will be different from zero. In other words,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial W'_{ij}} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial u_j}\frac{\partial u_j}
{\partial W'_{ij}}
\label{eq:derivative}
\end{equation}

For $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial u_j$

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial u_j} = -\delta_{jj^*} + y_j := e_j
\label{eq:term}
\end{equation}

Where, $\delta_{jj^*}$ is a Kronecker delta: it is equal to 1 if $j=j^*$, otherwise 0.

$e$ is the difference between the target (label) and the predicted output, i.e., it is the prediction error vector


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The backpropagation algorithm for the CBOW model}

For the second term on the right hand side of eq.\ref{eq:derivative}, we have

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial W'_{ij}} = \sum_{k=1}^V W_{ik}x_k
\label{eq:term}
\end{equation}

After inserting eqs.\ref{eq:term} and \ref{eq:term} into eq. \ref{eq:derivative}, we obtain

\begin{equation}
% \bbox[white,5px,border:2px dotted red]{
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial W'_{ij}} = (-\delta_{jj^*} + y_j) \left(\sum_{k=1}^V W_{ki}x_k\right)
% }
\label{eq:backprop1}
\end{equation}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The backpropagation algorithm for the CBOW model}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We can go through a similar exercise for the derivative $\partial\mathcal{L}/\partial W_{ij}$
	\item however this time we note that after fixing the input $x_k$ 
the output $y_i$ and node $j$ depends on all the elements of the matrix $W$ that are connected to the input
\item Therefore, this time we have to retain all the elements in the sum. 
\item Element $u_k$ of the vector $u$ as 
\end{itemize}

  \begin{equation*}
u_k = \sum_{m=1}^N\sum_{l=1}^VW'_{mk}W_{lm}x_l\ .
\end{equation*}

From this equation it is then easy to write down $\partial u_k/\partial W_{ij}$
since the only term that survives from the derivation will be the one in which $l=i$ and $m=j$ or 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial W_{ij}} = W'_{jk}x_i\  .
\label{eq:term}
\end{equation}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Vectorization}
We can simplify the notation of eqs. \ref{eq:backprop1} and \ref{eq:backprop2} by using a vector notation. Doing so, we obtain for eq. \ref{eq:backprop1}

\begin{equation}
% \bbox[white,5px,border:2px dotted red]{
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial W'} =  (W^T\textbf{x}) \otimes \textbf{e}
% }
\end{equation}

where the symbol $\otimes$ denotes the outer product, that in Python can be obtained using the numpy.outer method.

For eq. \ref{eq:backprop2} we obtain

\begin{equation}
% \bbox[white,5px,border:2px dotted red]{
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = \textbf{x}\otimes(W'\textbf{e})
% }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Applying these results to gradient descent}

 In order to apply gradient descent, after fixing a learning rate 
$\eta>0$
 we can update the values of the weight vectors by using the equations
 
 \begin{eqnarray}
W_{\textrm{new}} & = W_{\textrm{old}} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} \nonumber \\
W'_{\textrm{new}} & = W'_{\textrm{old}} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W'} \nonumber \\

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Iterating the algorithm}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item In order to conclude the first pass, we have to go through all our training examples. 
	\item Once we do this, we will have gone through a full epoch of optimization. 
	\item At that point, most likely we will need to start again iterating through all our training data, until we reach a point in which we don’t observe big changes in the loss function. 
	\item At that point, we can stop and declare that our neural network has been trained!

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Loss Function}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At this first iteration, the loss function will be the negative logarithm of the second element of $y$ (becuase thats the target ``1''):
	
	$\mathcal{L}=-\log\mathbb{P}(\textrm{“like”}|\textrm{“I”})=-\log y_3 = -\log(0.7445479)= 0.2949781.$ 
	\item We could also calculate it using eq. \ref{eq:loss} , like so:
	
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{L}=-u_2+\log\sum_{i=1}^4 u_i=-1.10720623 + \\
\log[\exp(-1.54350765)+\exp(1.10720623) \\ 
+\exp(-1.25885456)+ \\
\exp(-0.61514042)]=0.2949781.
\end{eqnarray*}
\item At this point, before going into the next training example (“like”, “playing”), we have to change the weights of the network using gradient descent. 
\item How to do this? 
\item The backpropagation algorithm is the answer!
