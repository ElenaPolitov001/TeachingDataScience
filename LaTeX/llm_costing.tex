%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Linear Pricing at Scale}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pricing increases significantly at scale.
    \item Linear pricing model as a justifiable cost line item.
    \item AI-driven cost reduction example: \$1 to 10c with GPT-4.
    \item Potential for volume discounts with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Usage-Based Pricing Models}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Models like Claude or PaLM follow usage-based pricing.
    \item Pay only for what you use, similar to Serverless compute.
    \item Ideal for experimentation and identifying impactful use cases.
    \item Contrast with upfront investment in private models and fine-tuning.
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{OpenAI Fine-Tuning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fine-tuning cost: \$8 for 1000 conversations, each with 1000 tokens.
    \item Ongoing conversation cost: 1.5c per interaction.
    \item Cost-effective for relevance and training on company data.
