\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is a Language Models?}

\begin{itemize}
\item While typing SMS, have you seen it suggests next word?
\item While typing email, have you seen next few words are suggested?
\item How does it suggest? (suggestions are not random, right?)
\item In the past, for ``Lets go for a \ldots', if you have typed 'coffee' 15 times, 'movie' say 4 times, then it learns that. Machine/Statistical Learning.
\item Next time, when you type ``Lets go for a '', what will be suggested? why?
\item This is called Language Model. Predicting the next word. When done continuously, one after other, it spits sentence, called Generative Model.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{GPTs Series}


\begin{itemize}
\item GPT + Generative Pre-trained Transformers
\item GPT-1, GPT-2 and GPT-3 are similar in terms of architecture 
\item Differ on the data and the number of transformer blocks with the number of incoming tokens.

\end{itemize}	 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{GPTs Trainings}


\begin{itemize}
\item GPT-1 is trained in a self-supervised manner (learn to predict the next word in text data) and fine-tuned in a supervised learning manner. 
\item GPT-2 is trained in a fully self supervised way, focusing on zero-shot transfer
\item  GPT-3 is pre-trained in a self supervised manner exploring a bit more the few-shots fine-tuning.
\item GPT-1 is pre-trained on the BooksCorpus dataset, containing ~7000 books amounting to ~5GB of data
\item GPT-2 is pre-trained using the WebText dataset which is a more diverse set of internet data containing ~8M documents for about ~40 GB of data
\item GPT-3 uses an expanded version of the WebText dataset, two internet-based books corpora that are not disclosed and the English-language Wikipedia which constituted ~600 GB (45TB?) of data

GPT being a decoder only model, takes words vectors (does this conversion internally), then through set of Decoder blocks, to spit out the next word one by one

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Misalignment Issue}


\begin{itemize}
\item GPT-3 was trained to predict the next word. Not much of context there.
\item Introducing prompting : provide with certain samples and context

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Curated Training Data}


\begin{itemize}
\item To fix this misalignment, humans must be involved in teaching GPT, and in this way, GPT will be able to generate better questions as it evolves.
\item Reinforcement Learning based on Human Input (rewards if aligns) was leveraged.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Prerequisites: What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?}


\begin{itemize}
\item RL is a method of achieving a goal via rewards. Find best path to get maximum points (game below)
\item Agent: Makes the moves
\item Reward: Positive or Negative (as shown)
\item State: Current position, location.
\item Action: Move done by the Agent
\item Policy: Sequence of Actions that Agent takes to achieve the goal, say, Down-Down-Right-Right-Right (reward 6)..there could be other paths and one(or more) of then can be the best.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{RL in context of ChatGPT}


\begin{itemize}
\item Agent: the model, it spits out words
\item Reward: score at predicting each next word
\item State: prompt + sentence generated so far
\item Action: Predicting the next word
\item Policy: Sequence of words and then total rewards for them.
\item Manual person can chose between such sequences (or polices) and label which is best. Then PPO can happen to adjust backwardly the reward function.
\item So, the Reinforcement Learning is used to capture human preferences and reduce misalignment.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Step 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Have a prompts dataset 
\item Let human laborer get the correct response for them
\item Do fine-tuning of GPT 3.5 using this data via supervised learning (SFT). 
\item Simple but very expensive.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Step 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item For a prompt, generate multiple responses from the fine-tuned model, one after another.
\item Human feedback provides a ranking of responses
\item This data is used to build Rewards Model (RM)

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Step 3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Take unseen prompt. Pass it through Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model which has been initialized with SFT. It generates a response (ie inferencing via SFT).
\item Calculate reward for that response via RM model. This reward is used to update the PPO model (loss function, back-propagation)
