Describe Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and types of analysis done in it.[4]

  - Variable Identification
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bi-variate Analysis
  - Missing values treatment
  - Outlier treatment
  - Variable transformation
  - Variable creation

Describe types of data with examples.[6]

 - Categorical types (Qualitative): Nominal and Ordinal
		- Nominal (numbers do not give sense of order/rank): eye color, zip codes
		- Ordinal (numbers give sense of order/rank): rankings, size in small-	medium-large
 - Numeric types (Quantitative): Interval and Ratio
		- Discrete: A discrete attribute has a fi nite or countably infinite set of values. 
		- Binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes.
		- Continuous: A continuous attribute is one whose values are real numbers.
		- Interval: calendar dates
		- Ratio: counts, time

Describe types and subtypes of Machine Learning algorithms [4]
		Supervised: 
			- Prediction: predicting a continuous variable from data
			- Classification: assigning records to predefi ned groups
		Unsupervised:
			- Clustering: splitting records into groups based on similarity

Write Pandas Python function for the following: [6]
 - Create Series using dictionary, with keys as index cities = pd.Series(d)
 - Find top 10 rows of dataframe df.head(10)
 - Find columns of dataframe df.columns
 - Find statistical summary of dataframe df.describe()
 - Select single column in dataframe df['A']
 - Find sub-dataframe from 1st to 3rd row, all columns df[0:3]
