\begin{frame}[fragile]{Difference across technologies, old to new}
Lets see how the solutions to the problem of detecting a cat from images using traditional programming, deep learning, and generative AI, respectively.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Traditional Programming}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Traditional programming involves writing explicit rules to detect a cat in images.
    \item Features like color, texture, and shape can be used to define these rules.
    \item However, designing accurate rules for complex patterns like cat detection can be challenging.
    \item It requires extensive domain knowledge and might not generalize well to different images.
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Deep Learning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Deep learning utilizes neural networks to automatically learn features for cat detection.
    \item Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image classification tasks.
    \item Large labeled datasets of cat images are used to train the network.
    \item The network learns to identify unique cat features and generalize them to detect cats in new images.
    \item Deep learning offers better accuracy and can handle complex patterns without explicit rule definition.
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Generative AI}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generative AI focuses on generating new data, including images of cats.
    \item Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate realistic cat images.
    \item The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator that compete against each other.
    \item The generator learns to generate increasingly realistic cat images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real from generated images.
    \item The generated cat images can be used to augment datasets for cat detection models.
  \end{itemize}
