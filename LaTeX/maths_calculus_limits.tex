Average velocity is 10 m/s
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Practical Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Say, Pune (P), and Mumbai (M) are 200km apart.
\item It takes 4hrs to cover the distance, so the average velocity is $\frac{200}{4} = 50kmph$.
\item Is that the velocity throughout the journey?
\item At Wakad, it could be 20, highway it could be 100, etc.
\item Within Lonawala, which is about 1km wide, whats the average velocity? you can measure from start, end of 1km, and decide.
\item What's the velocity while crossing Maganlal shop? which is about 10m long?
\item We are narrowing down, to find what is called `instantaneous' velocity.
\item Very small, infinitesimally small, a point.
\item Limiting condition.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Instantaneous Velocity?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secant is an approximation, not an exact speed at a particular moment.
\item We need slope of a curve AT A SINGLE POINT (and not approximate average between two secant points)
\item If we want slope at a particular x, we can find slope of a secant between x1 and x2 which are very close to x.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Instantaneous Velocity?}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a point on the curve ,say, (3,10)
\item From left and right sides we can approxa the point.
\item Y values at such nearby points is called as LIMIT

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Continuity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most functions we looked at so far, are continuous for all real values of $x$
\item Meaning if you trace them, you need not lift your pen.
\item Not all functions are defined like that.
\item $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x+1}, x \leq -2 | x \geq 0$
\item Obviously, there is a gap in the domain as well as output, so not continuous.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Finding Limits}
 What is meant by finding limits of a function at a particular x?
\begin{itemize}
\item Go from left side (ie less of x, increasing) and see to which value $f(x)$ is approaching.
\item Go from right side (ie more of x, decreasing) and see to which value $f(x)$ is approaching.
\item If both results are same, we got the limit value.
\item Even if $f(x)$ is not defined for that x, the limit value exists!!!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Finding Limits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lets look at obvious non continuous function
\item Need to find limit of function at x = -1
\item From negative side, the $f(x)$ is projected to go to 3.7 or so for x = -1
\item From positive side, the $f(x)$ is projected to go to -0.3 so for x = -1
\item Both do NOT agree. So limit does not exists.

If we were to plot every fractional value of d(x) for x values between 24.9 and 25, we'd see a line that decreases indefinitely, getting closer and closer to the $x = 25$ vertical line, but never actually reaching it. Similarly, plotting every x value between 25 and 25.1 would result in a line going up indefinitely, but always staying to the right of the vertical $x = 25$ line.

$\lim_{x \to 25+} d(x) = \infty$
