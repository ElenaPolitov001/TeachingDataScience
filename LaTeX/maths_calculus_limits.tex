\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf What is a limit?}: Our best {\bf prediction} of a point we didn’t observe.
\item {\bf How do we make a prediction?}: Zoom into the neighboring points. If our prediction is always in-between neighboring points, no matter how much we zoom, that’s our estimate.

\item {\bf Why do we need limits?}: Math has “black hole” scenarios (dividing by zero, going to infinity), and limits give us an estimate when we can’t compute a result directly.

\item {\bf How do we know we’re right?}: We don’t. Our prediction, the limit, isn’t required to match reality. But for most natural phenomena, it seems to.

\item {\bf Limits let us ask ``What if?''}: If we can directly observe a function at a value (like x=0, or x growing infinitely), we don’t need a prediction. The limit wonders, ``If you can see everything except a single value, what do you think is there?''.

\item {\bf Prediction}: When our prediction is consistent and improves the closer we look, we feel confident in it. And if the function behaves smoothly, like most real-world functions do, the limit is where the missing point must be.

\begin{itemize}
\item Theoretically, the ball could have been anywhere, right?
\item We just don't know, but we can predict.
\item The predictions agree at increasing zoom levels.
\item The before-and-after agree. 
\item On the contrary: Imagine at 3:59 the ball was at 10 meters, rolling right, and at 4:01 it was at 50 meters, rolling left. What happened? We had a sudden jump (a camera change?) and now we can’t pin down the ball’s position. Which one had the ball at 4:00? This ambiguity shatters our ability to make a confident prediction.

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Practical Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Say, Pune (P), and Mumbai (M) are 200km apart.
\item It takes 4hrs to cover the distance, so the average velocity is $\frac{200}{4} = 50kmph$.
\item Is that the velocity throughout the journey? No. We want more refined answer.
\item At Wakad, it could be 20; on highway it could be 100, etc.
\item Say, you want to know: within Lonawala, which is about 1km wide-long, whats the velocity?: you can measure from start, end of 1km, and decide.
\item Going narrower: What's the velocity while crossing Maganlal shop? which is about 10m long?
\item Narrowing down more and more, to find what is called `instantaneous' velocity.
\item Very small, infinitesimally small, a point.
\item Thats the ``Limiting condition''
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Instantaneous Velocity?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secant is an approximation, not an exact speed at a particular moment.
\item We need slope of a curve AT A SINGLE POINT (and not approximate average between two secant points)
\item If we want slope at a particular x, we can find slope of a secant between x1 and x2 which are very close to x.

\begin{itemize}
\item The zoom level (delta, $\delta$) is the function input, i.e. the time in the video
\item The error margin (epsilon, $\epsilon$) is the most the function output (the ball’s position) can differ from our prediction throughout the entire zoom level
\item The absolute value condition ($0 < |x - c| < \delta$) means positive and negative offsets must work, and we’re skipping the black hole itself (when $|x - c| = 0$).

\begin{itemize}
\item Most functions we looked at so far, are continuous for all real values of $x$
\item Meaning if you trace them, you need not lift your pen.
\item Not all functions are defined like that.
\item $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{x+1}, x \leq -2 | x \geq 0$
\item Obviously, there is a gap in the domain as well as output, so not continuous.

 What is meant by finding limits of a function at a particular x?
\begin{itemize}
\item Go from left side (ie less of x, increasing) and see to which value $f(x)$ is approaching.
\item Go from right side (ie more of x, decreasing) and see to which value $f(x)$ is approaching.
\item If both results are same, we got the limit value.
\item Even if $f(x)$ is not defined for that x, the limit value exists!!!

\item Need to find limit of function at x = -1
\item From negative side, the $f(x)$ is projected to go to 3.7 or so for x = -1
\item From positive side, the $f(x)$ is projected to go to -0.3 so for x = -1
\item Both do NOT agree. So limit does not exists.

 True or False: 
 
If a function f is not defined at $x = a$ then the limit
$lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ never exists.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Answer}
False. 

$lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ may exist even if function f is undefined at $x = a$. The concept of limits has to do with the behavior of the function close to $x = a$ and not at $x = a$.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Quiz}
 True or False: 
 
$lim_{x\to a} f(x)  = + \infty$

and

$lim_{x\to a} g(x)  = + \infty$

then 

$lim_{x \to a} [ f(x) - g(x) ]$	is always equal to 0.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Answer}
False. 

Infinity is not a number and $\infty - \infty$ is not equal to 0. $+\infty$ is a symbol to represent large but undefined numbers. $-\infty$ is small but undefined number.

% \textbf{Fact}
% Suppose that $f(x,y)$ and $g(t)$ are continuous functions with $g$ defined on the range of $f$.  Then $g\circ f$ is continuous on the domain of $f$.
  

% \textbf{Example}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item  Where is the function $h(x,y)=|(x,y)|$ continuous?  
% \item  Where is the function $\sin(y/x)$ continuous?
% \end{enumerate}

% \textbf{Definition}
% If $f$ is a real valued function defined on $D\subseteq \mathbb R^n$, then we say that $\lim_{\vec{x}\rightarrow\vec{a}} f(\vec{x})=L$ if
% for all $\epsilon >0$, there is $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $|\vec{x}-\vec{a}|<\delta$, $|f(\vec{x})-L|<\epsilon$, where 
% $|\vec{x}-\vec{a}| =\sqrt{(x_1-a_1)^2 +\dots +(x_n-a_n)^2}$.
