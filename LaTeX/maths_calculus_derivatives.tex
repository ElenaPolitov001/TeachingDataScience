\item Note: A function may not be differentiable at every point; that is you might not be able to calculate the derivative for
every point on the function line. 
\item To be differentiable at a given point, the function must be continuous at that point, 
\item The tangent line at that point cannot be vertical, and the line must be smooth at that point 
\item Cannot suddenly change direction or have kinks

\begin{itemize}
\item A function below is not defined at certain points ($x = 10$)
\item At certain point ($x = 7$), it is multi valued.
\item At certain point ($x = 17$), the slope is vertical, so not differentiable.
\item At certain point ($x = 4$), there is sudden change in direction, so not differentiable.

\item So, $\lim_{h \to 0} g(h) = A$
\item For any given arbitrary $\epsilon > 0 $, there exists $\delta > 0$, so that if $0 < | h| < \delta$, then $|g(h) - A| < \epsilon$
