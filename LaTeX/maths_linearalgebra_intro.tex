\begin{itemize}
\item ``Algebra'' means, roughly, ``relationship'', between unknown numbers.
\item Without knowing x and y, we can still work out that $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ 

\item ``Linear Algebra'' means, roughly, ``line-like relationships''.

\item Meaning, not curve like, ie quadratic, cubic, sinusoidal, etc, right? \item Nothing in ``power'' term!!

\item An operation F is linear if scaling inputs scales the output, and adding inputs adds the outputs:

\begin{align*}
    F(ax) &= a.F(x) \\
		F(x+y) &= F(x) + F(y)
\end{align*}

\item When plotted, its a line!!
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Linear Equations}
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(x,y,z) = 3x + 4y + 5z$
\item Whats an example for this?
\item Can you represent this by multiplication of two vectors?
\end{itemize}
