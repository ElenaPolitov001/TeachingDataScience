% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{HVAC QnA}
% Prompt: ``Diagnose a frosted evaporator coil''

% Result: 
% ``There are several reasons why an evaporator coil may become frosted:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Low refrigerant levels: If the refrigerant levels in the system are too low, it can cause the
% evaporator coil to freeze. This is because the refrigerant is responsible for absorbing heat
% from the air, and without enough refrigerant, the coil will not be able to absorb enough heat
% to prevent freezing.
% \item Dirty air filter: A dirty air filter can restrict airflow to the evaporator coil, causing the coil
% to freeze.
% \item Blocked or restricted airflow: If the airflow to the evaporator coil is blocked or
% restricted, the coil may freeze. This can be caused by a number of things such as dirty ducts or
% registers, closed or blocked vents, or a malfunctioning blower fan.
% \item Obstruction in the drain line: A blockage in the drain line can cause water to back up and freeze on the coil.
% \end{itemize}	 
% It's important to fix the issue as soon as possible, as a frozen evaporator coil can lead to decreased
% efficiency and can cause damage to the unit.

% Prompt: ``How to respond to a customer who thinks an air conditioner is
% too expensive''

% Result: ``
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Understand their concerns: Find out why they think the air conditioner is too expensive.
% Are they comparing it to a lower-quality unit? Are they on a tight budget? Understanding
% their concerns will help you address them more effectively.
% \item Provide a detailed explanation of the costs: Explain the costs associated with the air
% conditioner, including the cost of the unit, installation, and any additional materials or labor
% that may be required.
% \item Compare costs with the benefits: Explain the benefits of the air conditioner, such as
% energy efficiency, durability, and long-term cost savings. Explain how the cost of the unit may
% be offset by energy savings in the long run.
% \item Offer financing options: If the customer is unable to afford the air conditioner upfront,
% offer financing options that can help them spread the cost over time.

% \ldots 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Provide a written estimate: Provide the customer with a detailed, written estimate that
% outlines the costs associated with the air conditioner and the benefits it will provide. This will
% help them make an informed decision.
% \item Provide a guarantee or warranty on the unit: Provide the customer with a guarantee
% or warranty on the unit to give them peace of mind in their investment.
% \item Provide an alternative solution: If the customer cannot afford the recommended
% solution, offer an alternative solution that fits their budget while still meeting their needs.
% \end{itemize}	 
% It's important to be patient, understanding and provide all the information customers need to
% make a decision that best fits their needs and budget.

% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Possible applications}



% \begin{itemize}
% \item Multi-Language Support: ChatGPT’s ability to translate languages can be combined with Arduino to create multi-language support for devices. This feature makes it possible for users from different countries to interact with the device in their language. For example, you can create a device that provides information about local tourist attractions and supports multiple languages.
% \item Home Automation: One unique application of this combination is in the field of home automation. With ChatGPT’s ability to understand and respond to natural language and the versatility of the Arduino platform, it’s possible to create a fully voice-controlled smart home system.
