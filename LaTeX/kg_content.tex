{\emph \ldots a set of discrete objects, each of which has some set of relationships with the other objects}

Euler: Can we take a walk to all 4 islands, without crossing any of the bridge twice?

Abstraction (Does size of islands matter?):

Solution: No way!! What's the rule?

Across an organization, every department can benefit from graphs to answer questions 
like who or what is important, what should I do next, and whatâ€™s unusual about this?
