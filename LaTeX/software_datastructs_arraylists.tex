\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What?}
		What do we use lists for?	

		\begin{itemize}
			\item To store a collection of data.
			\item To build other more complex/refined data structures!
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{How?}
		How do lists in Python work?

		\begin{itemize}
			\item 		They are array-based!
			\item   	So what's an array then?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Arrays}
		An array is a block of memory of fixed size that can hold multiple items of data.
It doesnâ€™t matter what the things are; they can be numbers, 
words or other arrays.

	\input{images/tikz/array.tex}

			\item 	\lstinputlisting{src/array.py}
			\item
			\item 	\lstinputlisting{src/array2.py}

			\item 	\lstinputlisting{src/array3.py}
	\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Arrays}

	
			How does this differ from a list?

			\begin{itemize}
				\item It's just memory.
				\item (Theoretically) All of same type, but in python, relaxation appears but all are essentially 'object's.
				\item It is \textit{finite}!
				\item Each element has unique index.
				\item Locating element is fast ($O(1)$).
				\item Adding and removing elements is difficult.
				\item 2D matrices are also arrays.
				\item Can be multi-dimensional (Matrix, Tensor)
			\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Array-based lists}

		An array-based list (like the \texttt{list} in Python) uses an array internally.

		How can we then grow the list (seemingly) infinitely?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The list uses multiple arrays stitched together.
			\item The list also has a finite size from the start, we just never notice.
			\item The list creates a new array of size $n+1$ when the array if full.
			\item The list creates a new array of size $n*2$ when the array if full.
			\item I don't know.
		\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Stitching arrays together}
		The list uses multiple arrays stitched together.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Although technically possible, keeping track of all of it is hell not pleasant.
			\item There are also benefits to having one continuous block of memory.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item For instance spacial caching benefits (Google it, if you are intrigued ;))
				\end{itemize}
				
			\item But the idea isn't a bad one per se. Having only single items blocks, forms the basis of the list we study
				after the break!
			\item A hidden maximum size?: 		The list also has a finite size from the start, we just never notice.
			\item Nope, we can grow it so long as there is memory available.
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{So... New arrays then?}
			\begin{itemize}
			\item When the initial array is full, we create a new one with more capacity.
			\item We copy over all existing elements into the new array\dots
			\item And we now have new space to grow!
			\item But by how much should we grow?	
			\end{itemize}

	Observations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adding one item, can trigger a full copy of the array...
			\item Does that make \texttt{append} an $O(n)$ operation?
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Just enough room}
		The list creates a new array of size $n+1$ when the array if full.
		
		Doing it often.
	
		What happens when we add $n$ elements to a list of size $1$?
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Every time we need to copy the full list.
			\item So $O(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i)$ time in total.
			\item So $O(n^2)$ to add $n$ elements\dots
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{More than enough room}
		The list creates a new array of size $n*2$ when the array if full.
		
		Doing it often
	
		What happens when we add $n$ elements?
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Amortized run time}
		Some operations have varying run times, but can be shown to be efficient when repeated multiple times. We call
		this an amortized run time.
	
Consider \ldots
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Consider a list of size $1$ and we add $n$ elements to it.
			\item This means we double the size of the list $\log_2(n)$ times.
			\item This means that in total we have: $O(n)$ time to add all elements.
			\item And $O\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\log_2(n)} 2^i\right)$ operations to copy when the list grows.
			\item This geometric sequence gets us to: $O(2^{\log_2(n)}) = O(n)$ operations.
			\item So $O(n)$ to add $n$ items!
		\end{itemize}
		
		We call this an amortized run time of $O(1)$ for the append operation!

		\item Freeing up space: When we remove sufficient items, we can free up space again.
		\item We do this when 25\% of the capacity is used.
	
		\item Why 25\%?:	Why not just when we drop below 50\% again?
		\item Thrashing:
		Thrashing is repeatedly claiming and releasing memory (and in this case copying the array).\\
		To avoid this, we use a different bound on when we release memory.
