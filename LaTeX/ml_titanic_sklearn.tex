\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Titanic competition}
\begin{itemize}
\item The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
\item It sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
\item One of the reasons for loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. 
\item Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Kaggle?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kaggle is a site where people create algorithms and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. 
\item Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. 
\item Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.
\item Indian counterpart is ``Analytics Vidhya''. 
\item Many competitions and good prizes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Titanic competition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. 
\item One of the most popular of these competitions is Titanic competition
\item In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Titanic competition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each Kaggle competition has two key data files that you will work with - a training set and a testing set.
\item The training set contains data we can use to train our model. 
\item It has a number of feature columns which contain various descriptive data, as well as a column of the target values we are trying to predict: in this case, Survival.
\item The testing set contains all of the same feature columns, but is missing the target value column. Additionally, the testing set usually has fewer observations (rows) than the training set.

Many machine learning algorithms do not work on strings and they usually require the data to be in an array, not a DataFrame. Show only the columns of type 'object' (strings):

\begin{lstlisting}
df_train.dtypes[df_train.dtypes.map(lambda x: x == 'object')]

Name        object
Sex         object
Ticket      object
Cabin       object
Embarked    object
dtype: object

\item     The Embarked\_Val as we decided to use dummy variables instead.
