Models for prediction:

\begin{itemize}
\item On data, derive features, put statistical techniques like regression. One model per task. That's Machine Learning.
\item Feed raw data, employ neural networks. One model per task. That's Deep Learning.
\item Use Text data, get embeddings, use ML/DL, say for classification. One model per task. That's Natural Language Processing.
\item Train neural network on large corpus, store weights and architecture, then add final layers for say classification on custom data+labels. That's Pretrained model. One model, many tasks.
\item Train Large Language Model, just supply instructions on what to do, works. One model many tasks. Zero-shot, few-shots.

\begin{itemize}
\item While typing SMS, have you seen it suggests next word?
\item While typing email, have you seen next few words are suggested?
\item How does it suggest? (suggestions are not random, right?)
\item In the past, for ``Lets go for a \ldots', if you have typed 'coffee' 15 times, 'movie' say 4 times, then it learns that. Machine/Statistical Learning.
\item Next time, when you type ``Lets go for a '', what will be suggested? why?
\item This is called Language Model. Predicting the next word. When done continuously, one after other, it spits sentence, called Generative Model.

\item For prompt \lstinline|What is 1,000,000 * 9,000?| GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) (an AI) sometimes answers 9,000,000 (incorrect). This is where prompt engineering comes in.
\item If, instead of asking What is \lstinline|1,000,000 * 9,000?|, we ask \lstinline|What is 1,000,000 * 9,000? Make sure to put the right amount of zeros, even if there are many:|, GPT-3 will answer 9,000,000,000 (correct). 
\item Why is this the case? Why is the additional specification of the number of zeros necessary for the AI to get the right answer? How can we create prompts that yield optimal results on our task? 			
\item That's Prompt Engineering.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Settings of Prompt}

\begin{itemize}
\item 'temperature':  before applying the softmax function, temperature is used scale the logits. With it, creativity or variability is allowed. If you re-run the prompt, with 0, no change, but with 1, lots of variation. Default is 0.7. With a temperature between 0 and 1, we can control the randomness and creativity of the model's predictions. Temperature defines how likely it is to choose less probable words. T=0 gives the same response every time because there's a 0% chance to choose any word but the most likely. T=1 just picks based on the model's base confidence.
\item 'top\_p' or 'nucleus sampling': specifies a sampling threshold during inference time, words passing the threshold are sampled for the output. Top-p goes for a minimal set of words, the probability of which does not exceed exceeds p. In practice, this means the following: if you choose reasonably high p, like 0.9, you would likely get a set of the most likely words for the model to choose from
\item Like the temperature, the top p parameter controls the randomness and originality of the model.
\item OpenAI documentation recommends using either one parameter or the other and setting the unused parameter to the neutral case, i.e. 1.0.
