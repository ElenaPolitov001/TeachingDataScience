    \begin{itemize}
        \item A problem solving paradigm
        \item Similar in some respects to both divide and conquer and backtracking
        \vspace{5pt}
        \item Divide and conquer recap:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Split the problem into \textit{independent} subproblems
                \item Solve each subproblem recursively
                \item Combine the solutions to subproblems into a solution for the given problem
            \end{itemize}
        \vspace{5pt}
        \item Dynamic programming:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Split the problem into \textit{overlapping} subproblems
                \item Solve each subproblem recursively
                \item Combine the solutions to subproblems into a solution for the given problem
                \item \textit{Don't compute the answer to the same problem more than once}

            \begin{itemize}
							\item Formulate the problem in terms of smaller versions of the problem (recursively)
							\item Turn this formulation into a recursive function
							\item Memoize the function (remember results that have been computed)

	\frametitle{Introduction}
		
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Dynamic programming is nothing but recursion + memoization
				\item Extension of recursion that further optimists time complexity by storing intermediate values of 
recursion so they don’t have to be re-computed. 
				\item The array/structure that stores these values is 
called a memo, and the process of storing them memoization. 
				\item A ``bottom up” approach uses 
``tabulation” instead of ``memoisation''. 
				\item Memoization is ``top-down'' because, like in the ﬁb(n) 
example, you compute $ﬁb(5)$ before looking for $ﬁb(4)$ which is needed to compute $ﬁb(5)$, whereas a 
bottom-up approach finds $ﬁb(4)$ and puts it in a variable/array before using it to computer $ﬁb(5)$ at 
all. 
				\item Tabulation is more efficient when all sub-problems must be solved at least once to get the final 
result (as in the $ﬁb(n)$ problem) but memoization is faster otherwise because it strictly only 
computers things that need to be computed. 
			\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
	\frametitle{Difference}
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item There’s a difference between divide and conquer (a class of algorithms) and dynamic programming 
(a technique for thinking about/approaching problems). 
\item In divide and conquer, the sub-problems 
don’t overlap. 
\item In DP, they do, and it’s optimal to cache the overlaps via memorization to optimize.

\item An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
\item A broken egg must be discarded.
\item The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
\item If an egg breaks when dropped, 
then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
\item If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.
\item A first-floor drop may break eggs, and eggs may survive
a drop from the highest floor.
