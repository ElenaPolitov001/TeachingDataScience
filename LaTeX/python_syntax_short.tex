\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{What is Python?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
\item Python is simple and easy to learn.
\item Python is open source, free and cross-platform.
\item Python provides high-level built in data structures.
\item Python is useful for rapid application development.
\item Python can be used as a scripting or glue language.
\item Python emphasizes readability.
\item Python supports modules and packages.
\item Python bugs or bad inputs will never cause a segmentation fault.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{The Python shell, I}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Python can be run from ``shell'', IDE, Notebook
	\item Start writing commands/expressions at the $>>>$ prompt.
 \item Shell/Command Line:
\begin{lstlisting}
> python

Python 3.5.3 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, May 12 2017, 16:16:49) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Python shell, II}
\begin{itemize}
\item Expressions are evaluated and the result is printed:
\item Line continuation with \\ 
\item The prompt changes to `\texttt{...}' on continuation lines and for loops, function definitions, etc.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> 2+2
4

>>> "hello" + \
... " world!"
'hello world!'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Overall Syntax}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comments are indicated with ``\#''
\item Multiple statements on the same line are separated with ``;''
\item No semicolon at the end of lines.
%\item a long line continue on next with ``\'' (it is not always needed)
\item Scope is obtained through indentation. 
\item Always indent next line if ``:'' is at the end of current line.
\item One script is can be run or imported by other modules.
%\item  assignment uses the equal sign ``=''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Assignment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assignment creates references, not values:
\lstinline{tmp = "hello"; tmp = 10}
the first string will be deallocated
%\item Contrary to C, assignment do not have value:
%\lstinline{y = (x = x + 1)}
% is invalid
\item As in C programming: \lstinline{x += 1} is valid
\item Pre/post increment/decrements: \lstinline{x++; ++x; x--;--x} are invalid
\item Multiple assignment (references to a unique object):\lstinline{x=y=z=1}
\item Multiple assignments: \lstinline{(x,y,z)=(3.5,5.5,`string')}
\item  Example of swapping variables value: \lstinline{(x,y)=(y,x)}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\begin{frame}[fragile]  \frametitle{Special variables}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Python relies on many special variables that can be accessed by your code.
%\item One is the \lstinline{name} variables.
%\item When a module is run, it contains the string \lstinline{main}.
%\item When the module is imported, it contains the modules name.
%\item You can add code that runs only when a module is called directly:\lstinline{if __name__ == __ main__: test()}
%\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}
