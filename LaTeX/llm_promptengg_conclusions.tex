Prompt Engineering is an Iterative Process:

\begin{itemize}
\item Try something
\item Analyze where the results do not match the expectations
\item Clarify instructions, gives examples, specify output format, specify constraints, etc
\item Test on a batch of known results.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
