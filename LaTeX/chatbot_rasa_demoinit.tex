 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Demo: Starter Pack}
% RASA Starter Pack
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Clone the starter pack provided by Rasa from https://github.com/RasaHQ/starter-pack-rasa-stack
% \item It gives latest running application
% \item Let's take a look at the folder structure and the files that were created 
% \item Install git, can git clone above package.
% \item \lstinline|cd starter-pack-rasa-stack;activate rasa; pip install -r requirements.txt|

% \end{itemize}

% RASA Starter Pack
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The ``domain.yml'' file describes the travel assistant's domain. It specifies the list of intents, entities, slots, and response templates that the assistant understands and operates with.
% \item The ``data/nlu\_data.md'' file describes each intent with a set of examples that are then fed to Rasa NLU for training.
% \item The ``data/stories.md'' file provides Rasa with sample conversations between users and the travel assistant that it can use to train its dialog management model.
% \item Rasa provides a lot flexibility in terms of configuring the NLU and core components. For now, we'll use the default ``nlu\_config.yml'' for NLU and ``policies.yml'' for the core model.
% \end{itemize}

 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Exercise: Check Installation}
% RASA Starter Pack
% \begin{itemize}
% \item May need to rename data files to have standard names, else use command line flags in the following commands
% \item Train
% \item Use Rasa Shell to execute.
% \item Look at data files to see what interaction has been coded.
% \item Accordingly run the chatbot
% \end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rasa Init}

\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir firstbot
cd firstbot
activate rasa_env
rasa init  --no-prompt
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Creates project structure and dummy files. 
\item Good to run and execute
\item You can run as is or add your data to nlu.md, stories.md and domain.yml; retrain and run.
\item If you get any warnings replace ``rasa'' with ``python -W ignore -m rasa ''
\end{itemize}

 \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rasa Shell}

To run the bot:

\begin{lstlisting}
python -W ignore -m rasa shell --quiet --cors * -m models 


# Sample Chat
Bot loaded. Type a message and press enter (use '/stop' to exit):
Your input ->  hi
Hey! How are you?
Your input ->  perfect
Great, carry on!
Your input ->  are you a bot?
I am a bot, powered by Rasa.
Your input ->  /stop
\end{lstlisting}

Now, sky is the limit \ldots

 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pipelines}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item RASA-NLU is made up of a few components, each doing some specific work (intent detection, entity extraction, etc.). 
% \item Each component may have some specific dependencies and installations. 
% \item Options like MITIE (NLP + ML), Spacy and Sklearn are available to choose from. 
% \item We will be using Spacy-Sklearn here.
% \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rasa NLU and Core}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Rasa NLU  with spacy\_sklearn pipeline (Most recent github, https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/installation/)
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install rasa_nlu[spacy]
% \end{lstlisting}
% \item Rasa Core (https://rasa.com/docs/core/installation/)
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install -U rasa_core==0.9.6
% \end{lstlisting}
% Note: we are not using the latest. Trying latest as well.
% % \item Language Model
% % \begin{lstlisting}
% % python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
% % python -m spacy link en_core_web_md en --force;
% % \end{lstlisting}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Alternatives}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item To use the tensorflow\_embedding pipeline you will need to install tensorflow as well as the scikit-learn and sklearn-crfsuite libraries. 
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install rasa_nlu[tensorflow]
% \end{lstlisting}
% \item MITIE : The MITIE backend performs well for small datasets, but training can take very long if you have more than a couple of hundred examples.
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install git+https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE.git
% pip install rasa_nlu[mitie]
% \end{lstlisting}
% \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Rasa Core}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Latest (Most recent github)
% \begin{lstlisting}
% git clone https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu.git
% cd rasa_nlu
% pip install -r requirements.txt
% pip install -e .
% \end{lstlisting}
% \item Ready installation
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install rasa_core
% \end{lstlisting}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}



% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 % \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{UI/Front-End}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Client UI can be a web page (using frameworks like Flask in Python) or a mobile app. 
% \item Flask is simple to code and runs locally. 
% \begin{lstlisting}
% pip install flask
% \end{lstlisting}
% \item More info at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/
% \item Many UI front-ends are possible, such as Facebook, Slack, etc. They need API based credentials for fetching what user types and posting the answers generated by Chatbot.
% \end{itemize}
