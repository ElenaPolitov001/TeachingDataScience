{\it ``The task of Information Extraction (IE) involves extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data and presenting it in a structured format.''}
\end{center}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Example}

We can extract the following information from the text:


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{ie13}
\end{center}


	\begin{itemize}
	\item Country – India, Captain – Virat Kohli
	\item Batsman – Virat Kohli, Runs – 2
	\item Bowler – Kyle Jamieson
	\item Match venue – Wellington
	\item Match series – New Zealand
	\item Series highlight – single fifty, 8 innings, 3 formats
	\end{itemize}

Makes text structured meaning with relationships (key value).

  \frametitle{Main tasks of Information Extraction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Named Entity Recognition (Chunking, Parsing)
    \item Relation Extraction 
    \item Relations like subject are syntactic, relations like person, location, agent or message are semantic
  \end{itemize}
