\frametitle{How AutoGPT Works}

\textbf{Concept behind AutoGPT}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AutoGPT goes beyond simple text generation like ChatGPT and GPT-4.
    \item It generates, prioritizes, and executes tasks, not limited to text generation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Task Generation and Execution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item AutoGPT understands the overall goal and breaks it into subtasks.
    \item It can dynamically adjust actions based on ongoing context.
    \item Uses plugins for internet browsing and access to gather information.
    \item Outside memory serves as a context-aware module for evaluation and task management.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Active Goal-Oriented Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transforms from a passive text generator to an active, goal-oriented agent.
    \item Constantly reprioritizes and executes tasks based on the context and situation.
\end{itemize}
