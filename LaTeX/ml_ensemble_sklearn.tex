\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Bagged Decision Trees}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Bagging performs best with algorithms that have high variance. A popular example are decision trees, often constructed without pruning.
	\item In the example shown, see usage of the BaggingClassifier with the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm (DecisionTreeClassifier). A total of 100 trees are created.
	\end{itemize}

Running the example, we get a robust estimate of model accuracy.

\begin{lstlisting}

seed = 7
kfold = model_selection.KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=seed)
cart = DecisionTreeClassifier()
num_trees = 100
model = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=cart, n_estimators=num_trees, random_state=seed)
results = model_selection.cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold)
print(results.mean())

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Boosting ensemble algorithms creates a sequence of models that attempt to correct the mistakes of the models before them in the sequence.
	\item Once created, the models make predictions which may be weighted by their demonstrated accuracy and the results are combined to create a final output prediction.
