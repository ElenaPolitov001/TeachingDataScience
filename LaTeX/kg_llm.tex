\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Abstract}

Graph query languages, while precise and powerful, can sometimes be challenging to comprehend and employ. 
However, employing natural language to construct and query graphs presents an ideal alternative. 
This approach is particularly suitable for Knowledge Graphs derived from textual data. 
This presentation explores the foundation, methodologies, and illustrative instances of utilizing LLMs to enhance KGs.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is KG?}

\begin{itemize}
\item A knowledge graph is a graph-based database that represents knowledge in a structured and semantically rich format. 
\item This could be generated by extracting entities and relationships from structured or unstructured data, such as text from documents. 
\item A key requirement for maintaining data quality in a knowledge graph is to base it on standard ontology. 
\item Having a standardized ontology often involves the cost of incorporating this ontology in the software development cycle.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is LLM?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Large Language Models (LLMs): Machine learning algorithms for interpreting, translating, and summarizing natural language texts.
\item Size: Span hundreds of gigabytes with trillions of parameters.
\item Deep neural networks: Learn from extensive training data to generate appropriate outputs.
\item Self-attention mechanisms: Capture relationships between words, even with incorrect positioning.
\item Transformer architecture: Implements self-attention mechanisms.
\item Training data: Accumulated from multiple sources (books, internet, articles, social media, research papers).
\item Applications: Conversational AI, content creation engines, search engines, customer service agents, etc.
Enhance natural language processing tasks.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How Can Knowledge Graphs and LLMs Work Together?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge graphs + Large Language Models (LLMs): Powerful solution to overcome LLM limitations.
\item Address hallucination problem: Improves query result accuracy.
\item Integrating knowledge graph with LLM: Incorporates contextual knowledge base.
\item Enables logical connections between concepts.
\item Utilizes structured and unstructured data.
\item Generates more accurate and relevant outputs.
\item Enhances reasoning and understanding.
\item Produces more meaningful text.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Why?}

\begin{itemize}
\item KnowledgeGraphs: Excellent for representing domain data.
\item Deliver answers through expert-formulated queries.
\item Large Language Models (LLMs): Allow any user to ask questions.
\item Retrieve comprehensive answers.
\item LLM answers lack user-specific information.
\end{itemize}
	
So, combining both will be a Win-Win situation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What?}

Solution: 

\begin{itemize}
\item LLM converts verbose query to GraphQL syntax.
\item GraphQL performs information retrieval.
\item LLM converts GraphQL response to verbose answer.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Query : \lstinline|How is Valve-104 connected to Reflux-401?|
\item Using the OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo LLM, provide the ontology of the RDF graph as the context prompt for the LLM.
\item Ask it to prepare some SPARQL
\end{itemize}	

\begin{lstlisting}
Sure! Here is an example of a SPARQL query that returns the sequence of nodes that connect two particular nodes, assuming that there is a unique path between them:
```
PREFIX connectivity: <http://example.org/ontology#>
SELECT ?path
WHERE {
  {
    <http://example.org/node1> (connectivity:connectedTo)+ ?path .
    ?path connectivity:connectedTo <http://example.org/node2> .
  }
}
```
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Property path syntax: Find paths connecting two nodes.
\item \lstinline|(connectivity:connectedTo)+|: Traverses arbitrary length path with "connectedTo" property.
\item Query result: \lstinline|"?path"| variable represents sequence of connecting nodes (as URIs).
\item Assumes unique path between nodes.
\item Multiple paths or cycles may result in multiple/incorrect results.
