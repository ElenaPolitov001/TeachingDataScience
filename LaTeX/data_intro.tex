	\begin{itemize}
		\item {\bf r = 1} City block (Manhattan, taxicab, $L_{1}$ norm) distance.
		\item {\bf r = 2} Euclidean distance ($L_{2}$ norm).
		\item {\bf r = $\infty$} Supreme ($L_{max}$ or $L_{\infty}$) distance. Here r is not put equal to $\infty$ but tends to or limit to $\infty$
\end{itemize}

Considering this formula for finding norm (ie length, or tcan be same as length of diff between a and b):

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Putting a very large number, say, 1000, for $v=[0 1 10]$, the norm would be $(0^{1000} + 1^{1000} + 10^{1000})^{1/1000}$. 
		\item Here the last number becomes very big, but its 1000th root gives the same number as answer ie 10. 

		\item So, this method biases towards large numbers.
