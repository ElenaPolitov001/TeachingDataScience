\begin{itemize}
\item  your.schema.org: is an internal version of schema.org that can be used to define shared ontologies that map to downstream BI and AI tools, providing a business-friendly understanding of the data across the organisation. 
\item Linked Data: Linked data is a way of publishing data on the web and linking it to other data sources. By publishing internal data as virtual or materialised Linked Data Sets you can ensure that your data is linked to other data sources, providing a universal view. 
\item Data Catalog: a Connected Data Catalog organises the Linked Datasets by the concepts in your.schema.org, providing a simple way to find data. 
\item By employing these standards, any organisation can construct a Shared Semantic Layer, which gives a uniform and consistent understanding of data. 
\end{itemize}
