\begin{itemize}
\item Initialize Q for all states s and actions a 
\item Initialize $\alpha=0.001,\gamma=0.9,\epsilon_{max}=1.0,\epsilon_{min}=0.01$
\item Repeat for n\_episodes
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialize state s 
	\item For each step of episode
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Choose a with epsilon-greedy 
		\item Perform a, get new state sâ€™ and reward r 
		\item $Q(s ,a)=Q(s,a)+ \alpha (r + \gamma max Q(s' ,a_{max})- Q(s ,a))$
		\item s = s'
