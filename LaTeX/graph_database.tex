\begin{frame}\frametitle{Background}

\begin{itemize}
\item A Database is a place to store application data, to process and query, etc

\item Relational databases (SQL) store data in tables. Strict schema.
\item Document?key-value databases (no-SQL) store data in dictionaries/json. Flexi schema.
\item A Graph Database is where data is stored in graph data structure ie nodes and edges.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{RDBMS}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cannot model or store data and relationships well, ie, without complexity
\item Performance degrades with umber and levels of relationships and database size
\item Query complexity grows with the need for JOINs
\item Adding new types of data and relationships requires schema redesign
\item More difficult if that needs to be done real time.
\end{itemize}

Remains steady as Database grows. Btw, suitable for graph like data only, and not like lists-queues like dataset where RDBM will work far better.
