%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Word Similarity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic Methods :  Edit Distance, WordNet, Porter's Stemmer, Lemmatization using dictionaries
\item Easily identifies similar words and synonyms since they occur in similar contexts
\item Stemming (thought $\rightarrow$ think) 
\item Inflections, Tense forms
\item eg. Think, thought, ponder, pondering,
\item eg. Plane, Aircraft, Flight
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Machine Translation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classic Methods :  Rule-based machine translation, morphological transformation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Sentiment Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classic Methods : Naive Bayes, Random Forests/SVM
\item Classifying sentences as positive and negative
\item Building sentiment lexicons using seed sentiment sets
\item No need for classifiers, we can just use cosine distances to compare unseen reviews to known reviews.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Other Applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Co-reference Resolution: Chaining entity mentions across multiple documents  - can we find and unify the multiple contexts in which mentions occurs?
\item Clustering: Words in the same class naturally occur in similar contexts,  and this feature vector can directly be used with any conventional clustering algorithms (K-Means, agglomerative, etc). Human doesn't have to waste time hand-picking useful word features to cluster on.
\item Topic modeling: Semantic Analysis of Documents: Build word distributions for various topics, etc.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Efficacy}
Intrinsic: evaluation on a specific/intermediate subtask
\begin{itemize}
\item  word analogies: “a is to b as c is to \underline{xxxx}?” 
\item  word similarity: correlation of the rankings
\end{itemize}
Extrinsic: evaluation on a real task
\begin{itemize}
\item  take some task (MT, NER, coreference resolution, …) or several tasks
\item   train with different pretrained word embeddings
\item  if the task quality is better -> win!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Domain Understanding}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Another big advantage is that  is that we can actually pre-train word embeddings that are applicable to many tasks. 
	\item Only caution is that these embeddings are generic text corpus and carry general meanings.
	\item If you want domain specific meanings, then you will need to build your own word embeddings.
	\item ``Shell'' in zoology could mean creature houses you find on sea shore, but the same word in CAD means Hollowing operation.
	\item ``Draft'' in legal domain is a rough document, where as in CAD it is Tapering operation.
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item They provide a fresh perspective to ALL  problems in NLP, and not just solve one problem.
\item Technological Improvement
\item Rise of deep learning since 2006 (Big Data + GPUs  + Work done by Andrew Ng, Yoshua Bengio, Yann Lecun and Geoff Hinton)
\item Application of Deep Learning to NLP - led by Yoshua Bengio,  Christopher Manning, Richard Socher, Tomas Mikalov
\item The need for unsupervised learning . (Supervised learning tends to be excessively dependent on hand-labeled data and often does not scale)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Single vector for a word (whats problem with that?)
\item Very vulnerable, and not a robust concept
\item Can take a long time to train
\item Non-uniform results
\item Hard to understand and visualize
\end{itemize}

{\Large Conclusion}
\end{center}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is a word embedding?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Word Embeddings are the texts converted into numbers
\item There may be different numerical representations of  same text. 
\item Many Machine Learning algorithms and almost all Deep Learning Architectures are incapable of processing strings or plain text in their raw form. 
\item They require numbers as inputs to perform any sort of job, be it classification, regression etc. in broad terms.
\item So, for the computer to be able to ''understand'' a vector representation of a word is required.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Captures Relationship}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Word embedding = vector representation of a word
	\item A word is `embedded' in $n$ dimensional space.
	\item Once the words are vectors, their prosperities can be utilized.
	\item One such property is dot product giving cosine similarity.
	\item Goal is to capture some sort of relationship in that space, be it meaning, morphology, context, or some other kind of relationship.
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Domains}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The choice of $n$ in word embedding space, is our choice.
	\item It can be tens or hundreds instead of millions (like one-hot encoded vectors).
	\item A lot of word embeddings are created based on the notion introduced by Zellig Harris'``distributional hypothesis'' which boils down to a simple idea that words that are used close to one another typically have the same meaning.
	\item Different word embeddings are created either in different ways or using different text corpora to map this distributional relationship
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What Next?}
Machines like humans need four things to understand language

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the words (semantics)
\item Build the ability to guess (language model)
\item Parse language specific rules and patterns (encoder-decoder, transformers)
\item Build on the experience (pre-training)
\end{itemize}

Ability to include non-language information (culture, visuals, etc) will improve language models.
