\item In this DAG, leaves are the input tensors, roots are the output tensors. 
\item By tracing this graph from roots to leaves, you can automatically compute the gradients using the chain rule.
\item In a forward pass, autograd does two things simultaneously:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item run the requested operation to compute a resulting tensor
	\item maintain the operationâs gradient function in the DAG.
	\end{itemize}
\item The backward pass kicks off when .backward() is called on the DAG root. autograd then:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item computes the gradients from each \lstinline|.grad_fn|,
	\item accumulates them in the respective tensorâs \lstinline|.grad| attribute
	\item using the chain rule, propagates all the way to the leaf tensors.

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Computional Graphs}
DAGs are dynamic in PyTorch

\begin{itemize}
\item The graph is recreated from scratch; after each \lstinline|.backward()| call, autograd starts populating a new graph. 
\item This is exactly what allows you to use control flow statements in your model; you can change the shape, size and operations at every iteration if needed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Computional Graphs}
Odd cases
\begin{itemize}
\item In case of a scalar loss function, and we need to compute the gradient with respect to some parameters. 
\item However, there are cases when the output function is an arbitrary tensor. 
\item In this case, PyTorch allows you to compute so-called Jacobian product, and not the actual gradient.
\item For a vector function $\vec{y}=f(\vec{x})$, where
$\vec{x}=\langle x_1,\dots,x_n\rangle$ and
$\vec{y}=\langle y_1,\dots,y_m\rangle$, a gradient of
$\vec{y}$ with respect to $\vec{x}$ is given by \lstinline|Jacobian matrix|

% \begin{align}
% \begin{align}J=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
      % \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{n}}\\
      % \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
      % \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{n}}
      % \end{array}\right)
% \end{align}
% \end{align}

\item Instead of computing the Jacobian matrix itself, PyTorch allows you to
compute **Jacobian Product** $v^T\cdot J$ for a given input vector
$v=(v_1 \dots v_m)$. This is achieved by calling `backward` with
$v$ as an argument. The size of $v$ should be the same as
the size of the original tensor, with respect to which we want to
compute the product
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Computational Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that when we call backward for the second time with the same argument, the value of the gradient is different. 
\item This happens because PyTorch accumulates the gradients, i.e. the value of computed gradients is added to the grad property of all leaf nodes of computational graph. 
\item If you want to compute the proper gradients, you need to zero out the grad property before. 
\item \lstinline|backward()| is equivalent to calling \lstinline|backward(torch.tensor(1.0))|, which is a useful way to compute the gradients in case of a scalar-valued function, such as loss during neural network training.

\frametitle{Activation Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Neural network consists of composing linearities with non-linearities, a long chains of affine compositions.
\item Non-linearities like $\tanh(x), \sigma(x), \text{ReLU}(x)$ are the most common.
\item Why these functions? I can think of plenty of other non-linearities.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Activation}

\begin{itemize}
\item The reason for this is that they have gradients that are easy to compute, and computing gradients is essential for learning. For example $ \frac{d\sigma}{dx} = \sigma(x)(1 - \sigma(x)) $
\item $ \sigma(x)$ less popular because the gradient vanishes very quickly as the absolute value of the argument grows. Small gradients means it is hard to learn. Most use tanh or ReLU.
\end{itemize}

 Note, all negatives are made 0 and positives kept as they are.

It should be clear that the output is a probability distribution: each element is non-negative and the sum over all components is 1.

\begin{itemize}
\item The function $\text{Softmax}(x)$ is also just a non-linearity, but it is special in that it usually is the last operation done in a network. 
\item This is because it takes in a vector of real numbers and returns a probability distribution.

\frametitle{Objective or Loss or Cost function}

\begin{itemize}
\item Neural network is being trained to minimize it.
\item The parameters of the model are then updated by taking the derivative of the loss function. 
\item An example loss function is the negative log likelihood loss, which is a very common objective for multi-class classification.
\item We can compute gradients with respect to all of the parameters used to compute it! Then we can perform standard gradient updates.
\item Let $\theta$ be our parameters,  $L(\theta)$ the loss function, and $\eta$ a positive learning rate. Then:

$$ \theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla_\theta L(\theta) $$

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Optimization}

\begin{itemize}
\item Training a model is an iterative process; in each iteration (called an epoch) the model makes a guess about the output, calculates the error in its guess (loss), collects the derivatives of the error with respect to its parameters (as we saw in the module), and optimizes these parameters using gradient descent.
\item Many optimization methods do something more than just this vanilla gradient update.
\item Many attempt to vary the learning rate based on what is happening at train time. 
\item Torch provies many in the torch.optim package, and they are all completely transparent. 
\item Using the simplest gradient update is the same as the more complicated algorithms. 
\item Trying different algorithms and different parameters 
\item Other choices: Adam or RMSProp will boost performance noticably.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Setting hyperparameters}

Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that let you control the model optimization process. Example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Epochs: the number times to iterate over the dataset
\item Batch Size: the number of data samples seen by the model in each epoch
\item Learning Rate : how much to update models parameters at each batch/epoch. Smaller values yield slow learning speed, while large values may result in unpredictable behavior during training.
\end{itemize}




Each epoch consists of two main parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item The Train Loop: iterate over the training dataset and try to converge to optimal parameters.
\item The Validation/Test Loop: iterate over the test dataset to check if model performance is improving.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Loss}


\begin{itemize}
\item Loss function measures the degree of dissimilarity of obtained result to the target value, and it is the loss function that we want to minimize during training. \item To calculate the loss we make a prediction using the inputs of our given data sample and compare it against the true data label value.
\item Common loss functions include \lstinline|nn.MSELoss| (Mean Square Error) for regression tasks, and \lstinline|nn.NLLLoss| (Negative Log Likelihood) for classification. 
\item \lstinline|nn.CrossEntropyLoss| combines \lstinline|nn.LogSoftmax| and \lstinline|nn.NLLLoss|.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Optimization pass}


\begin{itemize}
\item Optimization is the process of adjusting model parameters to reduce model error in each training step. 
\item Optimization algorithms define how this process is performed (in this example we use Stochastic Gradient Descent). 
\item All optimization logic is encapsulated in the optimizer object. Here, we use the SGD optimizer; additionally, there are many different optimizers available in PyTorch such as ADAM and RMSProp, that work better for different kinds of models and data.
\item We initialize the optimizer by registering the model's parameters that need to be trained, and passing in the learning rate hyperparameter.
\end{itemize}

\tiny{(Ref: Microsoft - Intro to Machine Learning using Pytorch)}


\begin{lstlisting}
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Optimization Pass}

Inside the training loop, optimization happens in three steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Call \lstinline|optimizer.zero_grad()| to reset the gradients of model parameters. Gradients by default add up; to prevent double-counting, we explicitly zero them at each iteration.
\item Back-propagate the prediction loss with a call to \lstinline|loss.backwards()|. PyTorch deposits the gradients of the loss w.r.t. each parameter.
\item Once we have our gradients, we call \lstinline|optimizer.step()| to adjust the parameters by the gradients collected in the backward pass.
\item We initialize the loss function and optimizer, and pass it to \lstinline|train_loop| and \lstinline|test_loop|.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Save and load the model}

\lstinline|torch.save| persists \lstinline|state_dict| which is an internal state dictionary storing the learned parameters.

Note: Be sure to call model.eval() method before inferencing to set the dropout and batch normalization layers to evaluation mode. Failing to do this will yield inconsistent inference results.

\tiny{(Ref: Microsoft - Intro to Machine Learning using Pytorch)}

\begin{lstlisting}
model = models.vgg16(pretrained=True)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'data/model_weights.pth')

# load_state_dict() load the parameters 

model = models.vgg16() # we do not specify pretrained=True, i.e. do not load default weights
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('data/model_weights.pth'))
model.eval()
\end{lstlisting}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Save and load the model}

If we want to store the architecture also, along with weights then pass the whole model to \lstinline|torch.save|

Note: This approach uses Python pickle module when serializing the model, thus it relies on the actual class definition to be available when loading the model.

\tiny{(Ref: Microsoft - Intro to Machine Learning using Pytorch)}

\begin{lstlisting}

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{ONNX}

\begin{itemize}

\item For this reason, a test variable of the appropriate size should be passed in to the export routine (in our case, we will create a dummy zero tensor of the correct size):
\end{itemize}

There are a lot of things you can do with ONNX model, including running inference on different platforms and in different programming languages.
