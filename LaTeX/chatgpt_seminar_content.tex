\begin{itemize}
\item While typing SMS, have you seen it suggests next word?
\item While typing email, have you seen next few words are suggested?
\item How does it suggest? (suggestions are not random, right?)
\item In the past, for ``Lets go for a \ldots', if you have typed 'coffee' 15 times, 'movie' say 4 times, then it learns that. Machine/Statistical Learning.
\item Next time, when you type ``Lets go for a '', what will be suggested? why?
\item This is called Language Model. Predicting the next word. When done continuously, one after other, it spits sentence, called Generative Model.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Prerequisites: What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?}


\begin{itemize}
\item RL is a method of achieving a goal via rewards. Find best path to get maximum points (game below)
\item Agent: Makes the moves
\item Reward: Positive or Negative (as shown)
\item State: Current position, location.
\item Action: Move done by the Agent
\item Policy: Sequence of Actions that Agent takes to achieve the goal, say, Down-Down-Right-Right-Right (reward 6)..there could be other paths and one(or more) of then can be the best.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{RL in context of ChatGPT}


\begin{itemize}
\item Agent: the model, it spits out words
\item Reward: score at predicting each next word
\item State: prompt + sentence generated so far
\item Action: Predicting the next word
\item Policy: Sequence of words and then total rewards for them.
\item Manual person can chose between such sequences (or polices) and label which is best. Then PPO can happen to adjust backwardly the reward function.
\item So, the Reinforcement Learning is used to capture human preferences and reduce misalignment.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{HVAC QnA}
Prompt: ``Diagnose a frosted evaporator coil''

Result: 
``There are several reasons why an evaporator coil may become frosted:
\begin{itemize}
\item Low refrigerant levels: If the refrigerant levels in the system are too low, it can cause the
evaporator coil to freeze. This is because the refrigerant is responsible for absorbing heat
from the air, and without enough refrigerant, the coil will not be able to absorb enough heat
to prevent freezing.
\item Dirty air filter: A dirty air filter can restrict airflow to the evaporator coil, causing the coil
to freeze.
\item Blocked or restricted airflow: If the airflow to the evaporator coil is blocked or
restricted, the coil may freeze. This can be caused by a number of things such as dirty ducts or
registers, closed or blocked vents, or a malfunctioning blower fan.
\item Obstruction in the drain line: A blockage in the drain line can cause water to back up and freeze on the coil.
\end{itemize}	 
It's important to fix the issue as soon as possible, as a frozen evaporator coil can lead to decreased
efficiency and can cause damage to the unit.

Are they comparing it to a lower-quality unit? Are they on a tight budget? Understanding
their concerns will help you address them more effectively.
\item Provide a detailed explanation of the costs: Explain the costs associated with the air
conditioner, including the cost of the unit, installation, and any additional materials or labor
that may be required.
\item Compare costs with the benefits: Explain the benefits of the air conditioner, such as
energy efficiency, durability, and long-term cost savings. Explain how the cost of the unit may
be offset by energy savings in the long run.
\item Offer financing options: If the customer is unable to afford the air conditioner upfront,
offer financing options that can help them spread the cost over time.

\item Provide an alternative solution: If the customer cannot afford the recommended
solution, offer an alternative solution that fits their budget while still meeting their needs.
