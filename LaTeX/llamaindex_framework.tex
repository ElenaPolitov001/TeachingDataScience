\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Data Connectors: powered by LlamaHub}


\begin{itemize}
\item Easily ingest any kind of data, from anywhere, into unified document containers 
\item Powered by community-driven hub, rapidly growing (90+ loaders and counting!)
\item Growing support for multimodal documents (e.g. with inline images)
\end{itemize}	

$<10$ lines of code to ingest from Notion

\begin{itemize}
\item Source documents are stored in a data collection, In-memory, MongoDB
\item Data indices help to provide a view of your raw data, Vectors, keyword lookups, summaries
\item A retriever helps to retrieve relevant documents for your query
\item A query engine manages retrieval and synthesis given the query. 
\end{itemize}
