\begin{itemize}

\item Shannon's entropy is defined for a system with N possible states as 
$\Large S = -\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i \log_2{p_i}$  where $p_i$  is the probability of finding the system in the  $i$-th state.

% \item In our example, our split yielded two groups ( $q=2$ ), one with 13 elements ( $N_1=13$ ), the other with 7 ( $N_2=7$ ). Therefore, we can compute the information gain as $\Large IG(x \leq 12) = S_0 - \frac{13}{20}S_1 - \frac{7}{20}S_2 \approx 0.16.$
% \item It turns out that dividing the balls into two groups by splitting on ``coordinate is less than or equal to 12'' gave us a more ordered system.

% \item We have successfully constructed a decision tree that predicts ball color based on its position. This decision tree may not work well if we add any balls because it has perfectly fit to the training set (initial 20 balls). 
% \item If we wanted to do well in that case, a tree with fewer ``questions'' or splits would be more accurate, even if it does not perfectly fit the training set.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item In many texts, ``iterations'' is used on X axis, which is easy to imagine in case of Neural Networks, where each epoch refines model by fitting better question/weights.
	\item In case of Machine Learning, there no iterations. How to detect Over-fitting in case of Decision Tree?
	\item Initially when, tree is small it has not fit the data yet, so its under fitting phase. Losses are HIGH for both, training as well as testing (validation)
	\item As more levels get added in tree or more degrees in polynomial regression, under-fitting reduces and losses come down.
	\item At one point, training loss still reduces but validation loss starts jumping up. Thats over-fitting. Model is fitting training data TOO tightly and is OFF the validation data.

\item Tree pruning identifies and removes subtrees within a decision tree that are likely to be due to noise and sample variance in the training set used to induce it.
\item Pruning will result in decision trees being created that are not consistent with the training set used to build them.
\item But we are more interested in created prediction models that generalize well to new data! 
\item Solutions: Pre-pruning (Early Stopping), Post-pruning
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pre-pruning Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item Stop creating subtrees when the number of instances in a partition falls below a threshold
\item Information gain measured at a node is not deemed to be sufficient to make partitioning the data worthwhile
\item Depth of the tree goes beyond a predefined limit
\item Benefits: Computationally efficient; works well for small datasets.
\item Downsides: Stopping too early will fail to create the most effective trees.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Post-pruning Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decision tree initially grown to its maximum size
\item Then examine each branch
\item Branches that are deemed likely to be due to over-fitting are pruned.
\item Post-pruning tends to give better results than pre-pruning
\item Which is faster? Post-pruning is more computationally expensive than pre-pruning because entire tree is grown
\item Techniques: Reduced Error Pruning;
Cost Complexity Pruning

%\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Reduced Error Pruning}
%\begin{itemize}

%\item Will look at different pruned subtrees and compare their performance on a test sample
%\item $\alpha$ determines the trade-off between misclassification error and the model complexity

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Regression Trees}
When predicting a numeric variable, the idea of a tree construction remains the same, but the quality criteria changes.
Variance around the mean:

$\Large D = \frac{1}{\ell} \sum\limits_{i =1}^{\ell} (y_i - \frac{1}{\ell} \sum\limits_{i =1}^{\ell} y_i)^2,$

where $\ell$ is the number of samples in a leaf,  $y_i$  is the value of the target variable. Simply put, by minimizing the variance around the mean, we look for features that divide the training set in such a way that the values of the target feature in each leaf are roughly equal.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Regression trees}
The fitting algorithm for learning such a tree is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider splitting on every possible unique value of every
single variable in the data. Pick the `best' split from amongst
all of these options.
\item Partition the training data into two classes based on step $1$.
\item Now, iteratively apply step $1$ separately to each partition of
the data.
\item Continue splitting each subset until an appropriate
stopping criteria has been reached.
\item Calculate the mean of all the training data in a terminal node
(i.e., `leaf') of the learned tree structure. Use this as the predicted
value for future inputs that fall within the same bucket.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Stopping criterion}
There are many commonly used stopping criterion, often used
simultaneously (if any is satisfied stop splitting the partition):
\begin{itemize}
\item minimum number of training samples in a node
\item maximum number of splits
\item minimum improvement in the best split
\item maximum depth of the tree
\end{itemize}
In practice, particularly for larger datasets, the maximum number
of splits is the mostly commonly used.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Decision Trees (Recap)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A decision tree or a classification tree is a tree in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. 
	\item The arcs coming from a node labeled with a feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the feature.
	\item Each leaf of the tree is labeled with a class or a probability distribution over the classes.
\item For instance, in the example below, decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of \textit{If-Then-Else} decision rules. 
\item The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Pros and Cons of Single Decision Tree}
Pros
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple interpretations
\item Can be built quickly.
\item Does built-in Feature selection. So, if any of the features does not get used in Splitting, it is, sort-of, ignored, not selected in prediction.
\end{itemize}
Cons
\begin{itemize}
\item Small changes in data affects structure of tree
\item So, instead of single tree, a collection of Trees is preferred
\end{itemize}
Such collection is called as `Ensemble'.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Ensemble Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently using one single classifier induced from training data as our model, to predict class of test instance
\item What if we used multiple decision trees?
\item Motivation: committee of experts working together are likely to better solve a problem than a single expert
\item But no ``group think'': each model should make predictions independently of other models in the ensemble
\item In practice: methods work surprisingly well, usually greatly improve decision tree accuracy
\end{itemize}
