\section{Tuning Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.25em % Set a negative itemsep value to reduce spacing between items
\item \textbf{Temperature}:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Controls the creativity of AI-generated text.
	\item High temperature (e.g., 0.8) results in more randomness and diversity in responses.
	\item Low temperature (e.g., 0.2) produces more focused and deterministic responses.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Top-p and Top-k}:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Used to fine-tune response length and diversity.
	\item Top-p considers the most probable words until the cumulative probability exceeds a threshold.
	\item Top-k retains the top-k most likely words as options.
	\item Both techniques prevent unrealistic or excessively long outputs.
