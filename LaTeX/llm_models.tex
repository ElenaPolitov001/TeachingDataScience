\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{GPT3 Limitations}




\begin{itemize}
\item  Unlike ChatGPT, GPT-3 doesnâ€™t store chat history, which can lead to you needing to re-inject the extra context into the
original prompt.
\item Tokens are currently limited to 4000 tokens per output. This includes both your initial prompt the text generated
from ChatGPT.

\end{itemize}
