\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Models:} Building blocks supporting different AI model types - LLMs, Chat, Text Embeddings.
\item \textbf{Prompts:} Inputs constructed from various components. LangChain offers easy interfaces - Prompt Templates, Example Selectors, Output Parsers.
\item \textbf{Memory:} Stores/retrieves messages, short or long term, in conversations.
\item \textbf{Indexes:} Assist LLMs with documents - Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Vector Stores, Retrievers.
\item \textbf{Chains:} Combine components or chains in order to accomplish tasks.
\item \textbf{Agents:} Empower LLMs to interact with external systems, make decisions, and complete tasks using Tools.
\end{itemize}
