\begin{itemize}
\item Reinforcement learning is well-suited for conversational systems (Sequential decision making)
\item Policy: seeded list of norms pre-programmed. A rule that the agent should follow to select actions given the current state. Its like a function, (Q-function)
\item Agent/model: based on policy, decides outcome. If the outcome is desired (reward), then policy is unchanged. If the outcome is not desired (penalty), policy is updated.
\item RL algorithm: drives both.
\end{itemize}
