\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Set expectations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Building some cool demos with LLMs : Easy
\item Actually building a product with LLMs : Hard
\item If you just want some cool demos to show customers that you’re ahead of the 
curve, go for it.
\item If you just want your team to experiment and build out LLM muscle, go for it.
\item If you want a product, set goals for what you expect that product will bring, and the 
resources you’re willing to invest.

In times of uncertainty, apply a decision-making framework to minimize regrets

Minimize risks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate how disruptive gen AI is to your business
\item Figure out your data story
\item Avoid big, sweeping decisions
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Evaluate how disruptive gen AI is to your business}

\begin{itemize}
\item If I don’t do anything, can competitors with gen AI make me obsolete?

		\item Creative work: advertising, design, gaming, media, entertainment
		\item A lot of document processing: legal, insurance, HR
	\end{itemize}	
		
		Go all in
\item If I don’t do anything, will I miss out opportunities to boost revenue?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Customer support: chat, call centers
		\item Search \& recommendation
		\item Productivity enhancement: automated note-taking, summarization, information aggregation
	\end{itemize}	
	
	Build vs Buy decision

\item If there are opportunities, what advantages do I have to capture them?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proprietary data
		\item A100s lying around
		\item Existing user base
	\end{itemize}
