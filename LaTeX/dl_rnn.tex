An ideal roommate who cooks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Can cook 3 dishes: Apple Pie, Burger, Chicken
\item Dish depends on the outside weather (only Sunny or Rainy)
\begin{itemize}
\item Sunny: Apple Pie
\item Rainy: Burger

This can be easily modeled as Neural network with known inputs and outputs.

\item Human thoughts have persistence; humans don't start their thinking from scratch every second. 
\item As you read this sentence, you understand each word based on your understanding of previous words.  
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{RNNs Intuition}

\begin{itemize}
\item One of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they are able to connect previous information to the present task
\item E.g., using previous video frames to inform the understanding of the present frame.
\item E.g., a language model tries to predict the next word based on the previous ones.

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item List the alphabet forward\ldots. you can do it, yes?
\item List the alphabet backward\ldots. hmmm\ldots perhaps a bit tougher.
\item Try with the lyrics of a song you know?
\item Why is it easier to recall forward than it is to recall backward? Can you jump into the middle of the second verse?\ldots hmm\ldots also difficult. Why?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item There's a very logical reason for this
\item You learned them as a sequence. 
\item You are really good at indexing from one letter to the next.
\item It's a kind of conditional memory. (Once you given a start of poem, you can recite it further)
\item All these  tasks are easier when you know what happened earlier in the sequence
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item However, it's not that you don't have the song in your memory except when you're singing it. 
\item Instead, when you try to jump straight to the middle of the song, you simply have a hard time finding that representation in your brain (perhaps that set of neurons).
\item It starts searching all over looking for the middle of the song, but it hasn't tried to look for it this way before, so it doesn't have a map to the location of the middle of the second verse.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you wanted to train a neural network to predict whats the next scene would be in the next frame, it would be really helpful to know where the scene was in the last frame! 
\item Sequential data like this is why we build recurrent neural networks.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Neural networks have hidden layers. Normally, the state of your hidden layer is based ONLY on your input data. 
\item So, normally a neural network's information flow would look like this:
$input \rightarrow hidden  \rightarrow  output$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is straightforward. Certain types of input create certain types of hidden layers. 
\item Certain types of hidden layers create certain types of output layers. 
\item It's kind-of a closed system. Memory changes this. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory means that the hidden layer is a combination of your input data at the current time-step and the hidden layer of the previous timestep.
$ (input + prev\_hidden) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$
\item Why the hidden layer? Well, we could technically do this. 
$(input + prev\_input) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
Here, we have 4 timesteps of a recurrent neural network pulling information from the previous hidden layer.
\begin{itemize}
\item $(input + empty\_hidden) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$
\item $(input + prev\_hidden) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$
\item $(input + prev\_hidden) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$
\item $(input + prev\_hidden) \rightarrow hidden \rightarrow output$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
\begin{itemize}
\item  In the hidden layer recurrence, we see a presence of every input seen so far. In the input layer recurrence, it's exclusively defined by the current and previous inputs. 
\item This is why we model hidden recurrence.
\item Hidden recurrence learns what to remember whereas input recurrence is hard wired to just remember the immediately previous datapoint. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Now compare and contrast these two approaches with the backwards alphabet and middle-of-song exercises. 
\item The hidden layer is constantly changing as it gets more inputs. 
\item Furthermore, the only way that we could reach these hidden states is with the correct sequence of inputs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
\begin{itemize}
\item  What's the practical difference? Let's say we were trying to predict the next word in a song given the previous. 
\item The ``input layer recurrence'' would break down if the song accidentally had the same sequence of two words in multiple places. 
\item Think about it, if the song had the statements ''I love you'', and ''I love carrots'', and the network was trying to predict the next word, how would it know what follows ''I love''? 
It could be carrots. It could be you. The network REALLY needs to know more about what part of the song its in.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{What is Neural Memory?}
\begin{itemize}
\item  It could be carrots. 
\item It could be you. 
\item The network REALLY needs to know more about what part of the song its in.
\item However, the ''hidden layer recurrence'' doesn't break down in this way. 
\item It subtely remembers everything it saw (with memories becoming more subtle as it they fade into the past).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{RNN - Neural Network Memory}
Normal NN process:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our input layer to the neural network is determined by our input dataset. 
\item Each row of input data is used to generate the hidden layer (via forward propagation). 
\item Each hidden layer is then used to populate the output layer (assuming only 1 hidden layer)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{RNN - Neural Network Memory}
\begin{itemize}
\item Just saw, memory means that the hidden layer is a combination of the input data and the previous hidden layer. 
\item How is this done?
\item Much like every other propagation in neural networks, it's done with a matrix. 
\item This matrix defines the relationship between the previous hidden layer and the current one.

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{RNNs advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item The applications of standard Neural Networks (and also Convolutional Networks) are limited due to:
\item They only accepted a fixed-size vector as input (e.g., an image) and produce a fixed-size vector as output (e.g., probabilities of different classes). 
\item These models use a fixed amount of computational steps (e.g. the number of layers in the model).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{lstm32}


\tiny{(Ref: Deep Learning A-Z - Kirill Eremenko)}
\end{center}

Weights are then updated in the back-propagation.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vanishing Gradients}

In RNN, information travels through time. In the figure below, each circle is not a node, but the whole layer.
During training, at each time step you can calculate error ($\epsilon$)

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{lstm33}


\tiny{(Ref: Deep Learning A-Z - Kirill Eremenko)}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vanishing Gradients}

Lets look at one single time step. Error is $\epsilon_t$. All the weights, not just below, but all (say, 50) the previous weights need to be updated. In forward pass $W_{rec}$ (Weight recurring) was the weight that was getting multiplied to output at each time step.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{lstm34}

\tiny{(Ref: Deep Learning A-Z - Kirill Eremenko)}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vanishing Gradients}
So in back-propogration, similar weight will again multiply to arrive at the previous steps. If $W_{rec}$ is small, values of gradient decrease rapidly (green arrows). Lower the gradient, updating weights ceases shortly. Rest of the network  does not get trained. 
\begin{center}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Vanishing Gradients}
So if $W_{rec}$ is small, you have Vanishing Gradient problem, else Exploding Gradient problem. It needs to  be 1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Why - Don't multiply}
\begin{itemize}
\item Means, instead of multiplying the previous hidden state by a matrix to get the new state, you add something to your old hidden state and get the new state (here its not called as ``hidden'' but ``cell'')
\item Why?

\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Why - Gate all operations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now we are capable of long term memory since we are not losing it by repeated multiplications.
\item But is storing everything useful?
\item Also, do we want to output everything we have stored at each instant.
\item NO.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile] \frametitle{Why - Gate all operations}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are 3 steps in RNN: input to hidden, hidden to hidden, hidden to output
\item LSTM regulates each with input, forget and output gates respectively.
\item Each of the gates are calculated as function of what we already know (ie previous) and the current input
\item Now our internal hidden state will becomes holy and restricted. So, its called as ``Cell''.

%One confusing bit, at least for me the first time I saw RNNs, is
%the relationship between time and samples. We typically restart

%This detail seems to be glossed over in most tutorials on RNNs,

%While we could unroll the RNN into a FF network and apply the algorithms
%we saw in Lecture 13, for both memory consumption and computational
%efficiency, techniques exist to short-cut this approach.
